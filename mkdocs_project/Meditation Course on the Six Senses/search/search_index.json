I would like to share what I have learned with you, so that you too may get the same benefit.</p> <p>Compared to other frameworks found in the suttas, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana is a way of entering into the Buddha's teaching that is understandable for modern (supposedly) rational humans, it is free from overt religious overtones, it requires no belief in anything unseen or supernatural, and can be experienced directly through introspection. </p> <p>Sa\u1e37\u0101yatana is also uniquely relevant to the modern human condition. It reveals in vivid detail how we produce our own suffering from reactions to sense experience. Although we are surrounded by material luxury and convenience unimaginable for the average person a few centuries ago, there's no associated decrease in psychological dis-ease. In fact, the opposite is true, we live in an age of unprecedented mental stress and psychological suffering. </p> <p>This only makes the Buddha more relevant than ever before, a unique historical spiritual master who didn't teach for the ultimate goal of a pleasant afterlife, or fellowship with God Almighty in heaven, or to realise some abstract concept like the True Self. He taught that the highest goal is a practical one, to understand the causes of suffering and to end suffering in this very life.</p> <p>pubbe c\u0101ha\u1e43 bhikkhave, etarahi ca dukkha\u00f1ceva pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101pemi, dukkhassa ca nirodha\u1e43. </p> <p>Previously and now at present, monks, I merely teach suffering and its cessation.</p> <p>MN22 alagadd\u016bpamasutta\u1e43</p> <p>Through understanding the theory of sa\u1e37\u0101yatana and putting it into practice, may you effectively reduce your psychological stress and ultimately eradicate it entirely. </p>"},{"location":"1.01%20About%20the%20Course.html#structure-of-the-course","title":"Structure of the course","text":"<p>We will start with establishing mindfulness on the experience of the six senses.</p> <p>Then we will examine how sense experience gets constructed, how each experience is a composite of multiple components, and the necessary conditions for any experience to arise.</p> <p>Then we will investigate how each and every experience has a certain pleasant, unpleasant or neutral feeling tone, and how you are reacting to those, forming intentions, generating craving, aversion and delusion, and acting out the responses in thought word and deed.</p> <p>Finally, we will look deeply into how each part of this process is stamped with the three marks of existence: impermanence, dis-ease, and the fact of being completely impersonal.</p> <p>Recognising each part of the process, it is possible to slowly change habitual unskilful responses into more skilful ones.</p> <p>For each step along the way, there will be</p> <ol> <li>Theory: Some written words on the topic at hand discussing ideas found in suttas, and how to apply them in practice.</li> <li>Practice: Guided meditation instructions to get you started on the path of introspection into the topic.</li> <li>Sutta Reading: for a broader view of the topic </li> </ol>"},{"location":"1.01%20About%20the%20Course.html#how-to-do-this-course","title":"How to do this course","text":"<p>This course is designed for self-study and can be completed at your own pace.

We all have a rich inner world of experience, from the taste of fruit juice to the feelings of joy and anguish. These experiential phenomena are private, accessible only to you, the individual experiencing them.</p> <p>Science can observe correlates of conscious experience, such as EEG patterns, fMRI scans, or physiological markers like heart rate and pupil dilation. However, these are only physical processes associated with consciousness, not consciousness itself. Fortunately, we do not need to solve the \"hard problem of consciousness\" - why and how brain activity gives rise to subjective experience - in order to be aware of our own subjective experiences. We merely need to pay attention to them. </p> <p>The Buddha's focus on sa\u1e37\u0101yatana is not for abstract knowledge or scientific understanding, but for seeing clearly how subjective experience gives rise to suffering, and how to get free from that. While neuroscience provides fascinating insights into the mechanisms of conscious experience from the 'outside', it has little to say, and offers little relief from psychological suffering happening on the 'inside'.</p> <p>Throughout this course, we will talk much about 'mind' and hardly ever mention the word 'brain'. The reason for this is simple: the mind and mental processes are available to experience, whereas as the brain and its processes are invisible to subjective experience.</p> <p>Even if it is outside the scope of scientific measurement, there is nothing more fundamental to being than subjective experience. For two and a half millennia, the Buddhist tradition has preserved a wealth of teachings and practical methods for working with this inner reality, mindfulness being just the tip of the iceberg. Through an open-minded engagement with the ideas and techniques, you can deepen your understanding of subjective experience and transform your relationship with it.</p>"},{"location":"1.01%20About%20the%20Course.html#the-miracle-of-instruction","title":"The miracle of instruction","text":"<p>When questioned about what is the most miraculous power, the Buddha rejected psychic abilities and mind reading, and instead said that the ability to instruct another is truly the most miraculous power.</p> <p>katama\u00f1ca, keva\u1e6d\u1e6da, anus\u0101san\u012bp\u0101\u1e6dih\u0101riya\u1e43? idha, keva\u1e6d\u1e6da, bhikkhu evamanus\u0101sati \u2013 \u2018eva\u1e43 vitakketha, m\u0101 eva\u1e43 vitakkayittha, eva\u1e43 manasikarotha, m\u0101 eva\u1e43 manas\u0101kattha, ida\u1e43 pajahatha, ida\u1e43 upasampajja viharath\u0101\u2019ti.</p> <p>And what is the miracle of instruction?

The discourses are giving instructions for practice, how to think beneficially, how to avoid unskilful thought patterns, what to pay attention to, what to ignore, what to abandon and what to undertake and continue doing. When followed, these instructions lead one successively to a new understanding of reality that's not possible to reach by mere theoretical thinking, only through experiential understanding. </p> <p>So what we're attempting to do in this course is grasp the theory being taught, and, in a spirit of discovery, apply it within to see where it leads.

What's the mind doing in meditation? Many people have the image, contrary to their own experience, of a totally tranquil mind cleared off all thoughts, blissfully experiencing some sublime reality. And while that it is certainly one possible result of meditation, it doesn't come close to describing the range of activities that fall under the heading of meditation. </p> <p>The English word 'meditation' is a translation of many different P\u0101\u1e37i words, which are applicable in different contexts. The most common word translated as meditation is bh\u0101van\u0101. Literally it means \"causing to be\", more figuratively it can be rendered as 'development' or 'cultivation'. Implicit is the sense that, just like a farmer cannot make crops grow directly, but can supply all the necessary conditions for the cultivation of a field, we too cannot directly make the mind be a certain way, but we can provide the necessary conditions for mental cultivation, maturation and development. </p> <p>There are many different activities that constitute bh\u0101van\u0101. These include restraining the mind from certain harmful activities, cultivating beneficial perceptions to see things in a new light, actively thinking and reflecting on certain themes, non-judgemental awareness of phenomena as they are, and giving the deepest attention to the characteristics of experience. These are just some of the mediation activities described in the oldest Buddhist texts. </p> <p>Another word often translated as meditation is jh\u0101na, which refers to very specific stages of development that are common when practising meditation. The stages of jh\u0101na are a natural result of correctly practised bh\u0101van\u0101. It's like if different people are given directions to the same destination, they will all pass the same landmarks and features along the way, although each person will see those same landmarks through their own subjective filters.</p> <p>The meditation we're going to be practising in this course is awareness of naturally occurring sense experiences, as well as a detailed classification and analysis of those same experiences. If this does not fit with your preconceived idea of what meditation is, then please broaden your definition of meditation. </p>"},{"location":"1.02%20A%20note%20on%20meditation.html#the-right-posture-for-meditation","title":"The right posture for meditation","text":"<p>If you say the word 'meditation', what posture do you think of?

So turn your attention to what's already happening.   The sights, sounds, smells, tastes, physical sensations, and all the variety of mental phenomena that are present right now within experience.   There's no need to create any special experience, merely know what is happening right now.   What's happening to you right now is completely personal and unpredictable. But what is certain is that it will be some sight, some sound, some smell, some taste, some physical sensation or some mental activity. These are really the only experiences that ever happen.   Stay with experience. Follow whatever happens. Nothing special will happen, just normal everyday experiences.   Sounds, feelings in the body, thought appearing in the mind. Normal stuff. Pay attention to the normal stuff.   It can be quite relaxing just to pay attention to whatever is happening. There's no stress to do anything, just be relaxed, comfortable and know experiences as they come up.   Nothing is required other than some attention, some awareness of what is happening. All the rest happens quite naturally.   There's absolutely nothing to do. Just relax and know what's happening. That's the only job you have to right now. It's great work if you can get it!  What you're experiencing right now is the world of the senses. Six fields of sense experience, if your eyes are open -  seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling physical sensations, and a whole range of mental experiences. This is the place where we are going to be working. This is the *kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na*, quite literally, the place of work.   Whenever you get lost in thought, come back to your senses. Eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind.    This world of the senses is the only world you've ever known. Everything that's ever happened in your life has happened right here. Everything that every will happen, will happen right here. This is where it all happens.   You can tell others about your experiences, but nobody else has access to this. Your internal world, the immediate visceral experience of the six senses. This is your personal subjective reality. And the only reality you've ever really known.  Keep paying attention to the world of the senses.   Keep coming back to your senses.    <p>Next</p>"},{"location":"2.02%20Sense%20of%20sight.html","title":"2.02 Sense of sight","text":"<p>Let's begin by examining each sense individually through introspection.

Bring your attention to the visual field, the world of seeing, all the information coming through the eye channel.   If you're sitting down, open your eyes a little, you can defocus slightly. If you're walking or moving around, keep the eyes open and watch where you're going.  It doesn't matter so much what you're seeing, what objects you are looking at. The important thing is to know, right now the experience is of 'seeing'. There is a visual experience happening.   Look at the entire field of visual experience. All the different objects that you see are part of the visual field. Instead of looking at the objects, see the whole field. Not the objects of vision, but vision itself.  Focus on the act of seeing, the fact of seeing, the field of sight. Right now, seeing is happening. This is a visual experience.   ---  While you're seeing, you'll still be hearing, smelling, feeling physical sensations and thinking thoughts, but give priority to this process of seeing.  Give your full attention to the sense of sight.   ---  When your mind wanders off into thought, come back to this very simple, quite boring, sense of sight, knowing that right now you are seeing.   Seeing is almost always available to experience, but when nothing interesting is happening in the visual field, the mind will tend to wander off. This is part of the training, to condition your mind to stay where you put it. Sit, stay, good dog.   If you are easily distracted, just mentally note to yourself, \"seeing\", \"this is sight\", \"eye channel\" or whatever language is useful to you. Noting or labelling can be very helpful in the beginning to anchor the mind to the task at hand.   ---  Notice the types of objects in the visual field. Shapes, colours, light and dark. That's all the eye really perceives.  ---  Notice the range of the visual field. How far seeing extends to the left and to the right ... up and down.   Notice that you can't see above, below or behind you.  ---  Notice the accuracy of seeing, in focus in the centre, fuzzy everywhere else.  ---  Notice how attention automatically jumps to the other senses as soon as there is a strong stimulus coming from another sense field. It's perfectly natural, nothing to change. Just know that it's happening and bring the mind back to seeing.   ---  Notice how when you blink or close your eyes, your sense of sight temporarily disappears. And when you open the eyes again, your sense of sight reappears. It seems like stating the obvious, but this is something we will explore in more detail, the conditions required for seeing.   ---  This exercise is merely to orientate you to the sense of sight.   Later on we will move to more open awareness, and then you need to know very clearly, \"this is the sense of sight\", \"this is the eye channel\" so there will be no confusion about which sense you are experiencing.    ---  Keep coming back to this sense of sight.

Bring your attention to the auditory field, the world of sounds, all the information coming through the ear channel.   Straight away, notice how different the sense of hearing is from the sense of sight. It's a totally different experience to seeing.   Don't pay much attention to the things that you hear, to what the sounds are, birds, people talking, cars, but zoom out a little and pay attention to the fact of hearing, the act of hearing, the whole field of hearing.   All the individual sounds that you hear are just part of this auditory field.   Give your full attention to the sense of hearing.   ---   If you find it useful, note to yourself, \"hearing\", \"sounds\", \"ear channel\", or whatever language is useful to help bring your attention to this sense field. Use noting or labelling to support your attention when it is easily distracted from the simple act of hearing.   ---  Notice the spacial dimension of hearing, how it's three-dimensional, giving the impression of being 360 degrees around, above and below. So different from seeing, which is all upfront.   ---  This is hearing. The sense of hearing. A field of sound. The ear channel.   ---  Notice what the ear actually perceives. Hearing knows nothing about \"birds\" or \"cars\" or \"dogs\". It only knows high and low frequencies, loud and soft volumes, different tones. The words and labels come from the mind, not from the ear. These are two entirely different sense fields. Come back to the simple world of sounds, frequencies and tones.   ---  Close your eyes if they are open, stand still if you are moving about, and give your full attention to the field of sound.   ---  Notice how attention automatically jumps to the other senses as soon as there is a strong stimulus coming from elsewhere. Just know that it's happening and bring the mind back to hearing.  ---  Notice how the ears have no off button, there's no way to close the ears other than manually sticking your fingers in them. The ears are always on, day and night. The only way to stop hearing is to stop paying attention to sound.   ---   Paying attention to the senses like this is a kind of \"base level\" or \"default mode\" for mindfulness. Whenever you start cultivating attention, always start with these simple exercises and build up. In time, you will become very familiar with these fields of experience and be able to distinguish them very clearly from one another.

For this exercise it might be helpful to get up and walk around, in nature if you can, it's full of smells.   Bring your attention to the olfactory field, this whole world of smells, scents, odours, perfumes, all the information coming in through the nose channel.   Some people have a very strong sense of smell and are easily overwhelmed by smells. Others have a very weak sense of smell and only notice smells when they are very near and very strong. If you have a strong sense of smell, you should have no problem bringing your attention to the smells in your environment. If you have a weak sense of smell, perhaps you can actively go and sniff scented objects.  ---  If you find it useful, note to yourself, \"smelling\", or \"smells\", or \"nose channel\", or whatever language is useful to help bring your attention to this sense field. Use noting or labelling to support your attention, especially when it is easily distracted from the simple act of smelling.   ---  Immediately notice how different the sense of smell is from the sense of sight or hearing.   ---  Notice that there is no real directionality with the sense of smell. In order to get a bearing on the source, you need to physically turn your head. If you've ever watched a dog, which has an acute sense of smell, even they have to move their head about and stick their nose into things to locate the source of smells.   ---  Notice how different the sense of smells is when inhaling compared to exhaling.   ---  When you are around food and drink, it's a really good time to actively engage with the sense of smell. Most of what we call flavours are actually smells. There's no pineapple flavour, there's only pineapple smell and the accompanying sweet and sour flavours.  ---  When you engage with people, notice how strong smelling they are. To hide the fact that they are strong smelling, people use even stronger scents to mask their natural odour.  ---  Notice that smells are an entirely separate field of experience from seeing and from hearing. Smells are entirely within their own domain, and there's no crossover between smells and sights and sounds at the sense level at least.   ---  Notice the smells that you like. And the smells that you don't like. The smells that you can tolerate, even if they are strong. The smells that you can't tolerate, even if they are weak.

The time to do this is while eating, or drinking, or when there is something in your mouth.   The rest of the time, all you can really taste is the inside of your mouth and saliva, which you probably have become so accustomed to you may think there is no taste.   It doesn't matter so much what you're tasting, sweet, sour, salty or bitter, the important thing is to know that, right now, the experience is of 'tasting', this is the tongue channel.   ---  With taste, it's very important to differentiate the experience that is coming from taste and the experience that is coming from smell. These two are distinct.   If needs be, stop breathing for a moment, or pinch your nose closed to remove the sense of smell and focus exclusively on taste.   Explore this world of taste, sense information coming from the tongue.  ---  Focus on the act of tasting, the fact of tasting, the field of flavours, this is the tongue channel.   ---  Right now, tasting is happening.

So especially at those times, give your full attention to the tongue.   ---  Notice the initial flavour of a mouthful, how the taste changes over time, how quickly the flavour disappears, how, after a short time, even the most tasty food becomes utterly flavourless.   ---  Notice your response to tastes, things that you like the flavour of, things that you don't like, things that you're indifferent to. There's often not such a big difference in taste, but an enormous difference in perception and response to taste.   ---  Throughout the day, anytime anything goes into your mouth, focus on the flavour.

Bring your attention to the tactile field, this world of tangible sensations coming from nerve ending throughout your body, all the information coming through the body channel.

It doesn't matter so much what you're feeling, the important thing is to know, right now the experience is of 'feeling', 'sensations', 'body channel'. There is a somatic experience happening.  ---  All the different sensations that you feel in your body are part of the field of touch.  Focus on the act of feeling, the fact of feeling sensations, this whole field of tactile experience.   ---  Right now, physical sensations are happening. Give your full attention to the sense of touch.   ---  It doesn't matter if the sensations are strong or subtle, pleasant or unpleasant, quickly disappearing or long-lasting, just keep being aware of them as sensations. This is a bodily experience.    ---  When your mind wanders off into thought, come back to this ever present field of physical sensations.    ---  Notice how active this domain of physical sensations is, compared to smell or taste, how filled with continuous sensations the body is, there is always something happening somewhere in the body.   This is probably the most reliable meditation object, for beginners and advanced yogis alike, as there is always physical sensation to be felt. Perhaps this is the reason that the very first foundation of mindfulness is *k\u0101y\u0101nupassan\u0101*, following the experience of having a body. It is always available to be experienced.   ---  Feeling the body is always available to awareness. If you're alive, you're breathing, which creates sensations. Gravity is always pushing the body towards the earth, creating sensations wherever the body is making contact with a surface beneath it. These two things are always directly tangible through the sense of touch.  ---  There is always sensation to be experienced when the body comes into contact with any physical object, including itself. You just need to tune in to sensation, and it's always there.  ---  If you are easily distracted, just mentally note to yourself, \"feeling\", \"this is physical sensation\", \"touch\", \"body channel\", or whatever language is useful to you. Noting or labelling can be very helpful in the beginning to anchor the mind to the current task.  ---  Notice the types of objects in the field of touch - vibrating, throbbing, tingling, tickling, flowing, fluttering, itching, numbness, pinching, pulling, pushing, pricking, pulsating, rippling, radiating, aching, paining, stabbing, stinging, soothing ... so many types of sensation, all just physical sensations, part of the field of touch, experience-able through the body channel.   ---  Notice the sensations at all the points of contact, where one part of the body is touching another, or the body is touching some other physical object, your clothes, cushion, or the ground.  ---  If you're sitting, notice where your hands or arms are touching the legs, where the butt is touching the cushion beneath it, where the legs are touching each other, where the feet are touching the ground. If you're walking, notice the sensation where your feet touch on the earth.  ---  Be very still for a moment. Stop moving entirely. Notice all the sensations that the body generates itself, without any movement.   ---  Notice the range of the sense of touch. It is quite strictly limited to the body.  ---  Notice how sensation are prominent in certain areas of the body, the face, eyes, cheeks, lips, and scalp, the hands, the chest, the stomach area, the buttocks, the legs.   ---  Notice how sensations are difficult to discern or even absent in other parts of the body.  ---  Notice how physical sensations come out of nowhere, occupy your attention, change, and disappear, replaced by the next sensation which grabs your attention.    ---  There is a lot of change happening within physical sensation, this is very obvious from the beginning, and only increases with attention. You have very little control over these small, relentless changes in the body, which manifest as some sensation or another.    ---  Keep coming back to this sense of touch, what it feels like to have a body, this entire field of body awareness.    ---  Give these sensations your full attention.

I don't see any air. \" In the same way, someone may say, \"What mind? I don't see any mind.

Just know this is tasting, this is the gustatory field, this experience is coming through the tongue channel.   Feel whatever sensations you can feel in the body. Just know this is physical sensation, this is a bodily experience, this experience is coming through the body channel.   Turn your attention towards your mind and know whatever mental phenomena are occurring. How are you feeling today? Just understand, this is a mental experience, this is the mental field, this experience is coming through the mind channel.  It's helpful in the beginning to spend a few minutes clearly differentiating the six fields of experience.   Now that you've done the warm-up, it's time for the real exercise, which is open awareness, knowing whatever is happening as it is happening.  The best thing about this practice is you don't need to do much, you simply need to pay attention to what is already going on.  Instead of choosing which sense field to pay attention to, know whatever is occurring naturally. Attention normally moves between the senses, from seeing to a sound, to a sensation in the body, to another sensation in the body, to a thought, to another thought, to a memory, and so on. Your job is just to know whatever experience is present right now.  ---  Calmly follow whatever is happening as attention moves from this to that sense field.    Your job is to follow closely behind and know whatever is happening.  There's always some naturally occurring experience. Give your full attention to that.   ---  If you're walking, the primary experiences are going to be seeing, hearing, smelling, body sensations and thinking.   If you are sitting with eyes closed, your primary experiences are going to be hearing, body sensations and mental activity.  ---  Keep your attention on naturally occurring experience.   Keep following experience from one sense to the next.   ---  The biggest thing that will pull you away from the experience at hand is thinking, and not knowing that you are thinking. It is natural to start thinking, there is nothing wrong with thinking, the mind forms thoughts all the time. But your job is to know what is happening, so when thinking, you must *know* that you are thinking. The *usual* case is you are completely involved in the story of a thought, it is *unusual* to know that this is thought. So when thinking, catch yourself, know, \"ah! This is thinking\" and come back to sense experience.   ---  Notice how when you start thinking, all the other sense fade into the background and the thought story takes the spotlight, front and centre in the mind. Your full attention is on thinking, not know that you are thinking. At the time, your eyes are open, but you are not seeing. The world is full of sounds, but you are not hearing. The body is full of sensations, but there may as well not be body. Know that thinking is just a mental experience, it happens on the mind channel. And come back to following naturally occurring experience.   ---  Keep knowing whatever is happening.   Keep following experience as it happens.   ---  Don't expect perfectly continuous awareness. This is a skill to be developed slowly over time. Do the best you can. It's so helpful to know that you're no longer paying attention, only then can you bring your attention back to the senses.   Don't try to force any kind of experience to happen. Just know what's naturally occurring. The only thing that you're adding is awareness. Other than that, let things unfold as they do.   Don't get frustrated if it seems difficult in the beginning and you keep losing awareness. That is also a normal part of the process.   Keep knowing whatever is happening.   Keep following experience.  ---  The most vital skill in the beginning to catch the mind when it wanders off. Just to know that it has wandered off, that is now folly engrossed in a mental story, oblivious to all other experiences. This is the most useful gift that you can possibly give yourself. It will really help you to come out of the deeply ingrained habit of getting totally absorbed in your own stories, and not even knowing that it's a story. Come back to the experience at hand, come back to your senses.  ---  Keep following whatever experience is happening. It happens, and you're right behind it with awareness.   ---  Following whatever experience is happening, watching it appear, morph and be replaced by the next experience. Attention naturally moving to another sense, a new experience arises, changes and disappears. Your job is just to keep following this naturally occurring process.   ---  This is how to train attention, how to make attention powerful, discriminative, tuned into the most subtle changes and, most importantly, continuous.   ---  What's happening?   <p>Next</p>"},{"location":"2.09%20Name%20the%20Channel.html","title":"2.09 Name the Channel","text":"<p>Open awareness is a very useful, versatile, foundational skill in mental training. Using it as a base, there are numerous exercises that can be practised to develop analytical skills and insight. The first step along that path is being able to clearly discern what field of experience is happening, or as we shall call it, \"naming the channel\".</p> <p>Naming the channel is one of the easiest way to build up speed and accuracy of analysing what kind of experience is happening. And it is reasonably easy to do. </p> <p>When seeing, just note, \"eye channel\" or \"eye\".</p> <p>When hearing, just note, \"ear channel\" or \"ear\".</p> <p>When smelling, just note, \"nose channel\" or \"nose\".</p> <p>When tasting, just note, \"tongue channel\" or \"tongue\".</p> <p>When feeling physical sensation, just note, \"body channel\" or \"body\".</p> <p>When a mental experience is occurring, just note, \"mind channel\" or \"mind\".</p> <p>Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. That's all. </p> <p>This ability to quickly and accurately name the channel of experience will be very useful in the meditations which follow later in the course, related to understanding dependency and developing insight.</p> <p>Naming the channel has the added benefit of helping you to stay with actual experience and not run off into habitual thoughts, daydreams and fantasies. In the beginning, noting is useful as an anchor to present moment experience. </p> <p>It also helps with reconditioning the mind to perceive in a new way. The normal mode of human perception is entirely focused on the objects of awareness, and what goals can be achieved with those objects. How is this person or thing useful, how can it be of benefit to you, or endanger you. Naming the channel re-frames perception to start noticing the structure of awareness. </p> <p>Something that becomes very apparent with practice is that there is no cross-over between the five senses. The information coming from the eye channel is a totally different type of information from what is coming through the ear channel. Hearing in no way blends with smelling. Tastes and bodily experience are entirely separate domains. But all five senses are available to the mind. </p> <p>In the beginning, this exercise may be a little bit chaotic. You're not used to interpreting experience in this way. Your usual mode is more object-orientated and goal-orientated.

Firstly, establish open awareness.   Calmly, know whatever is happening right now.  Be receptive to whatever comes up, you're not choosing to have this or that experience. Just notice whatever is prominent right now, and give your full attention to that.   Experiences come up, change and disappear to be replaced by the next one. Allow your attention to move fluidly from one experience to the next.  ---  Every single experience is happening within its own field. Just for a moment, note which field it belongs to. Name the channel.  Note all sights as \"eye channel\" or \"eye\" for short.  Note all sounds as \"ear channel\" or \"ear\" for short.  Note all smells as \"nose channel\" or \"nose\" for short.  Note all tastes as \"tongue channel\" or \"tongue\" for short.  Note all physical sensations as \"body channel\" or \"body\" for short.  Note all mental experiences as \"mind channel\" or \"mind\" for short.  Know each experience and note the channel of experience.  ---  Know what is happening and name the channel it is happening on.  ---  While seeing a sight, know that this is seeing, the sense of sight, this experience is happening on the eye channel. Pay attention to *all* the information coming in on the eye channel.  While hearing a sound, know that this is the sense of hearing, this experience is on the ear channel. Pay attention to *all* the information coming in on the ear channel.  When smelling a scent, know that this is the sense of smell, this experience is on the nose channel. Pay attention to *all* the information coming in on the nose channel.  When tasting a flavour, know that this is the sense of taste, this experience is on the tongue channel. Pay attention to *all* the information coming in on the tongue channel.  While feeling a physical sensation, know this is the sense of touch, this experience is on the body channel. Pay attention to *all* the information coming in on the body channel.  While thinking a thought, or having any other mental experience, know this is the sense of mind, this experience is happening on the mind channel. Pay attention to *all* the information coming in on the mind channel.  Clearly know each experience, briefly name the field, and come back to the experience at hand.  ---  If naming the channel gets tiring or difficult, come back to simple open awareness for a minute, calmly knowing what is happening as it is happening.   You may also find the opposite, that naming the channel gives a very powerful boost to the clarity of mindfulness. If that's the case please continue with it.  --- Know each experience and name the channel of each experience.  ---  Know each experience as it occurs, and mentally note the name of the sense field.  ---  If you are only able to note the channel every ten seconds, then note it every ten seconds.  If you are able to note the channel once a second, then note it once a second.   If you are able to note the channel ten times a second, then note it ten times a second.  ---  Keep following experiences as they occur.

Etymologically it is composed of the prefix vi- which implies separation or distinctness, the root \u221a\u00f1\u0101 simply means 'to know', and the suffix is -ana is used to form neuter process nouns. So a very literal translation of vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a would be 'the act of knowing distinctly'. </p> <p>One important thing to understand about the Buddha's use of the word vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a is that he frequently stresses its dependent nature, the fact that it can never exist without supporting conditions. Nowhere in the whole mass of early texts can you find a reference to consciousness without an object, such as the common Indian ideas of a 'universal consciousness' or 'primordial consciousness' which is taken as a ground of being. The Buddha strongly rejected this idea. In Buddhism, consciousness always refers to 'consciousness of', awareness of a certain category of sense experience. Consciousness, in early Buddhist teachings, is never an abstract metaphysical construct, it is an observable mental process. </p> <p>The dependency of consciousness is explicitly discussed in suttas such as the Great Discourse on the Simile of the Elephant's Footprint in Majjhima Nik\u0101ya. </p> <p>seyyath\u0101pi, \u0101vuso, ka\u1e6d\u1e6dha\u00f1ca pa\u1e6dicca valli\u00f1ca pa\u1e6dicca ti\u1e47a\u00f1ca pa\u1e6dicca mattika\u00f1ca pa\u1e6dicca \u0101k\u0101so pariv\u0101rito ag\u0101ra\u1e43 tveva sa\u1e45kha\u1e43 gacchati, evameva kho, \u0101vuso, a\u1e6d\u1e6dhi\u00f1ca pa\u1e6dicca nh\u0101ru\u00f1ca pa\u1e6dicca ma\u1e43sa\u00f1ca pa\u1e6dicca camma\u00f1ca pa\u1e6dicca \u0101k\u0101so pariv\u0101rito r\u016bpa\u1e43 tveva sa\u1e45kha\u1e43 gacchati. </p> <p>ajjhattika\u00f1ceva, \u0101vuso, cakkhu\u1e43 aparibhinna\u1e43 hoti, b\u0101hir\u0101 ca r\u016bp\u0101 na \u0101p\u0101tha\u1e43 \u0101gacchanti, no ca tajjo samann\u0101h\u0101ro hoti, neva t\u0101va tajjassa vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47abh\u0101gassa p\u0101tubh\u0101vo hoti. ajjhattika\u00f1ceva, \u0101vuso, cakkhu\u1e43 aparibhinna\u1e43 hoti b\u0101hir\u0101 ca r\u016bp\u0101 \u0101p\u0101tha\u1e43 \u0101gacchanti, no ca tajjo samann\u0101h\u0101ro hoti, neva t\u0101va tajjassa vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47abh\u0101gassa p\u0101tubh\u0101vo hoti. yato ca kho, \u0101vuso, ajjhattika\u00f1ceva cakkhu\u1e43 aparibhinna\u1e43 hoti, b\u0101hir\u0101 ca r\u016bp\u0101 \u0101p\u0101tha\u1e43 \u0101gacchanti, tajjo ca samann\u0101h\u0101ro hoti. eva\u1e43 tajjassa vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47abh\u0101gassa p\u0101tubh\u0101vo hoti.</p> <p>Say, for example, a space enclosed by logs, vines, grass, and clay goes by the name of a 'house'.

Your eyes are in good working order. There is a something right in front of you, but it is too dark to see, do you see anything? In the language of the suttas, does 'visual consciousness arise'? No. But if your eyes are in good working order, and there is something right in front of you, and there is light enough to see it, will you be aware of see something? Of course. The suttas would say uppajjati cakkhuvi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a\u1e43, 'visual consciousness arises', there is awareness of seeing something.</p> <p>So let's investigate this within our own experience, seeing that for any conscious experience to occur, the internal and external conditions must be fulfilled, namely a working eye and something to see.

Contact is the convergence of three conditions, the sense base, the sense object and the corresponding consciousness.  Without these conditions in place, there is no experience to be talked about.   Let's analyse conscious experience of the six sense fields.   Open your eyes if they are closed and look at something in your visual field.   This conscious experience of seeing is the *phassa* the Buddha was talking about, the coming together of three conditions.  Just for a moment, analyse the three conditions for this visual experience to take place. For this experience to happen, there must be  1. eyes to see 2. forms that are seen 3. eye consciousness, which knows that are seeing  The eyes, by themselves, see nothing. Forms cannot be seen without the eyes. And there is no eye consciousness independent of the eyes and forms. What you are seeing is the composite of the three.   Intellectually you can break them apart, but this is a composite experience, if you remove any one condition, the entire experience ends. Test that out by closing your eyes. Or by looking away at something else.  You are not seeing forms out there, but a very neat reconstruction within your own mind.   Pick another experience in the visual field and analyse it according to these three conditions.   Each visual experience consists of 1, 2, 3. things.   Spend some time analysing your visual experiences in this way.   ---  Pick something that you can hear, an experience in the auditory field.   This too is a composite of three conditions  1. the ear 2. the audible sound vibration 3. ear consciousness, knowing that you are hearing  What you are hearing is not out there, but a reconstruction in your mind. If you remove any one of three conditions, the experience does not occur.   Pick another sound in your environment and perform the same analysis. What are the three conditions?  Spend some time analysing your auditory experiences in this way.  ---  Find something in your environment to smell.   This experience of smell is a composite of three conditions.   1. a nose 2. some scented molecules 3. nose consciousness, the mind's ability to know smells  What you are smelling is not 'out there', but a composite, a reconstruction in the mind which is composed of these three things.   If you remove any one of these three conditions, the experience ends. Test that out by blocking your nose. Or moving away from the smell.   Pick another smell in your environment and perform the same analysis.   Spend some time analysing your olfactory experiences in this way.  ---  When you are eating or drinking, pay attention to any taste experience which occurs.   This taste is a composite of three conditions 1. tongue 2. flavoured molecules 3. tongue consciousness, the ability to know flavours  The taste experience is not in your mouth, it is a reconstruction in the mind, made up of these three components.   If you remove any one of these three conditions, the experience ends. No tongue, no flavours, no tongue consciousness, no tasting.  As you are eating or drinking, keep analysing every taste, identify the three conditions for taste to occur.   Spend some time analysing your taste experiences in this way.  ---  Pay attention to some physical sensation that is occurring in your body.

Keep watching your mental experiences and perform the same analysis. What are the necessary conditions for this to occur?  Spend some time analysing your mental experiences in this way.  ---  Now come back to open awareness. As often as you are able, pick one experience.

Keep analysing contact, each conditioned conscious experience.    <p>Next</p>"},{"location":"3.06%20Creating%20the%20World.html","title":"3.06 Creating the World","text":"<p>\"sabbaloka\u1e43 abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101ya, sabbaloke yath\u0101tatha\u1e43, sabbalokavisa\u1e43yutto, sabbaloke an\u016bpayo.  </p> <p>Deeply understanding the whole world,  Everything in the world as it truly is,  Disentangled from the whole world,  Not drawn into the whole world.</p> <p>ITI112 Itivuttaka 112</p> <p>As we are exploring this world of the senses, it should become apparent that the world is not something \"out there\", but really something that is continually being manufactured \"in here\". </p> <p>We always assume that we're experiencing reality, what I'm seeing is reality, this is what's really out there. What I'm hearing are sounds that exist out in the world, independent of me. Everything that is coming through the senses have, to use the Sanskrit word, svabh\u0101va, their own independent existence. This misconception is almost universal, an extremely persistent illusion. </p> <p>But as we go deeper into exploring this process of sense experience, it becomes obvious that and we're not experiencing reality, we are experiencing an aspect of something that's really out there, let's say a vibration in the air, which gets filtered through the sense organ of the ear, reduced into a small frequency band, turned into an electrical signal which gets passed onto and processed by the brain, which we have no experience of, until it appears in the mind and gets evaluated according to everything that we've ever experienced previously. That's an entirely different scenario from hearing what's out there. </p> <p>In one way, our senses give us a lot of information about the outside world. But another of looking at it is they really limit what we experience into a small, narrow band, and bin the rest as irrelevant. </p> <p>Do you notice that you hear nothing below 20-25Hz? There's a whole world of frequency there, but we're deaf to it. Do you notice that you hear nothing over 22kHz? Dogs wonder why humans can't hear the loudest and most obvious sounds. So rather than hearing what's out there, we're actually being presented with a small slither of frequency by the ear.</p> <p>Science tells us how mechanical impulses get converted into electrical impulses in the inner ear, but we have little no experience of that, or what's happening to that electrical signal in the brain. The first time we become aware of it is when the mind manufactures a little theatre set, presenting us with a semi-realistic, internally created scene of something that happened out in the world a few moments earlier. And what's the first thing we do in response to that? Ignore it! Unless of course it's loud enough to capture out attention, or offers some advantage or disadvantage to us. </p> <p>Another example. You have the very distinct impression that you're looking out onto the world, but actually the inverse is true, the world is coming into you. Science tells us that light hits the retina and gets converted into some chemical signal, which becomes an electrical signal, which gets processed in the brain somewhere near the back of the head, in darkness and upside down apparently, but that is not available to experience. The first thing that you know about it is when the picture appears in the mind a short time later, a very realistic simulation of looking out onto the world. The illusion is amazingly persistent, despite the fact that we know science and introspection are both saying the same thing, in different ways - you are constructing the world.</p> <p>So you're never seeing or hearing the world out there, you are seeing and hearing your own locally manufactured facsimile of a small slice of the world out there. That's what you're responding to. That's what you're loving and hating - a reconstructed image in the mind. </p> <p>There's been a lot of talk in the last few years about a philosophy called simulation theory, which suggests our reality might be an advanced computer simulation, where what we experience as the physical universe is actually a sophisticated digital construct created by a technologically superior civilisation. In this simulation nothing is real, hence the name, everything is part of the digital simulation.</p> <p>From a sense point of view there, is no vast digital simulation necessary. We are each living in our own little organic simulation of the world. You manufacture the world in real time as you pass through it, an entirely believable simulation, so real that you actually ascribe qualities of the experiences occurring in your mind to the objects out in the world, going as far as to love and hate the simulated phenomena within your own mind. </p> <p>We are living in the age where people are very confident about perceiving the world correctly and perceiving it a certain way, which is obviously a true and accurate reflection of reality. But it should be obvious to any meditator how seemingly rational adults can come to such outrageously different conclusions about what is actually happening in the world. Nobody is seeing anything which even comes close to resembling objective reality. Everybody is creating their own version of the world and taking that as some kind of given truth. What's really amazing is that there is any consensus at all among people, that's much more surprising really!</p> <p>You might argue that there is an external world, there are overseas countries, people on the other side of the world, other planets and distant galaxies. Certainly there are, and many things outside the range of the senses, and scientific instruments too! But look carefully where the outside world is actually happening. It occurs as a mental phenomenon happening in the mind, as you are thinking about those things. Without the subjective aspect, it simply doesn't exist. </p> <p>This is what the Buddha was pointing at when he talked about sabba\u1e43, all of it, everything. </p> <p>sabba\u1e43 vo, bhikkhave, desess\u0101mi. ta\u1e43 su\u1e47\u0101tha. ki\u00f1ca, bhikkhave, sabba\u1e43? cakkhu\u00f1ceva r\u016bp\u0101 ca, sota\u00f1ca sadd\u0101 ca, gh\u0101na\u00f1ca gandh\u0101 ca, jivh\u0101 ca ras\u0101 ca, k\u0101yo ca pho\u1e6d\u1e6dhabb\u0101 ca, mano ca dhamm\u0101 ca \u2013 ida\u1e43 vuccati, bhikkhave, sabba\u1e43. yo, bhikkhave, eva\u1e43 vadeyya \u2013 ahameta\u1e43 sabba\u1e43 paccakkh\u0101ya a\u00f1\u00f1a\u1e43 sabba\u1e43 pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101pess\u0101m\u012b\u2019ti, tassa v\u0101c\u0101vatthukamevassa, pu\u1e6d\u1e6dho ca na samp\u0101yeyya, uttari\u00f1ca vigh\u0101ta\u1e43 \u0101pajjeyya. ta\u1e43 kissa hetu? yath\u0101 ta\u1e43, bhikkhave, avisayasminti.</p> <p>Monk's let me tell you about everything, Listen carefully. What is everything? The eye and forms, the ear and sounds, the nose and scents, the tongue and flavours, the body and tangible sensations, the mind and mental phenomena, this is what's called everything. Anyone who says \"I reject this everything and will tell you about another everything\", that would merely be baseless talk. Questioned further, he would struggle to answer, and would fall into some further difficulty. Why is that? Because it is outside of one's domain.</p> <p>SN35.23 sabbasutta\u1e43</p> <p>In that same way that a six-piece band can play hundreds, thousands of different pieces of music, these six senses produce all the experiences in our entire life.</p> <p>A simple question: have you ever experienced a single thing in your entire existence that's outside the field of the six senses? </p> <p>The Buddhist version of simulation theory has been around for two and a half thousand years, except it posits that we're living in small organic simulation of the world, produced with bits of the world, which we have never seen independently, on our local hardware. Unlike simulation theory, this kind of simulation is entirely real, and is all you've even known your whole life.</p> <p>The world doesn't have sights, sights are created by visual frequencies, the eye and the mind. </p> <p>The world doesn't have sounds, sounds are created by the audible frequencies, the ear and the mind.</p> <p>The world doesn't have smells, smells are created by the aromatic chemicals, the nose and the mind. </p> <p>The world doesn't have tastes, tastes are created by the taste-able chemicals, the tongue and the mind. </p> <p>The world doesn't have tactile sensations, tactile sensations are created by the physical contact, the body and the mind. </p> <p>And it goes without saying that all mental phenomena are created by qualia and the mind. </p> <p>What we're engaging in here is a process of deconstructing the way that we habitually see the world, in order to see clearly see that we're not really responding to the world, but responding to our internally generated construction of the world. Everyone you have ever loved, everything you have ever hated, everything that you've ever been indifferent to was not out there, you are loving and hating and ignoring your own mind. In a way you are just loving, hating and indifferent to yourself. In another way, it's all just empty phenomena arising and passing away. </p> <p>Now you should be able to definitively answer the philosophical question, \"If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?\" Without an ear and ear consciousness, no, of course not. More importantly, there's also no tree and no forest either, without an observer to see them.</p> <p>Each conscious experience simultaneously creates the illusion of a pre-existing experiencer, experiencing and a pre-existing world.

It has the -an\u0101 suffix which creates feminine abstract process nouns, the process of doing something abstract. But before giving a definitive meaning, perhaps it's useful to discuss what vedan\u0101 is not, so that we can clearly understand what it is.</p> <p>Vedan\u0101 is sometimes translated as 'emotion'. It's definitely not an emotion like anger or sadness, it is much simpler than that. </p> <p>Vedan\u0101 in Sanskrit texts can often mean 'perception'. That is completely unrelated to the Buddhist use of the word. </p> <p>In modern Indic languages, vedan\u0101 can even mean 'pain' or even 'agony'. Again, that's not the primary meaning found in ancient Buddhist texts. </p> <p>Vedan\u0101 is sometimes translated as 'feeling' or 'sensation', which is getting warmer, but is misleading in that vedan\u0101 is not a feeling or sensation in the body, it is entirely mental. </p> <p>So what is vedan\u0101, and how does the word get used in the context of the early discourses? Here's a useful definition: In immediate response to every single instance of phassa, conscious sense experience, there is a pleasant, unpleasant or neutral feeling tone in the mind. Obviously there is no English word covers the full range of this definition, so perhaps it's best to leave the word untranslated to minimise confusion.</p>"},{"location":"3.07%20Vedan%C4%81.html#some-examples-of-vedana","title":"Some examples of vedan\u0101","text":"<p>Think of the warm sun on your skin on a cold day.

Take a look at your mind, the unpleasantness of the experience is dukkha-vedan\u0101, an unpleasant feeling tone in response to the experience.</p> <p>But by far the most common response to experiences is adukkham-asukha-vedan\u0101, a neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling tone in response to an experience.

Let's begin with open awareness. Simply experience whatever is naturally occurring right now.   You should be familiar with the types of experiences that you have through the six sense channels.   And you should be familiar with analysing those experiences in various ways.   Now we're going to note or label each experience according to the type of *vedan\u0101*.   There are only three types, pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral.   Or if you prefer, comfortable, uncomfortable and neither.   Or in P\u0101\u1e37i, *sukha*, *dukkha* and *adukkham-asukha*.  This experience you are having right now, what channel is it on? What is the *vedan\u0101*?  If an experience is not obviously pleasant or unpleasant, label it as neutral and move on to the next experience. In time, you may be able to distinguish more subtle levels of pleasantness and unpleasantness, but for now, if you cannot distinguish anything, label it as neutral and move on.  ---  For a while, pay attention to the sense of sight.   When looking at something, any beauty that you might perceive is closely associated with pleasant *vedan\u0101*.   Any ugliness that you might perceive is closely associated with unpleasant *vedan\u0101*.  But most experiences are neither pleasant nor unpleasant, so label them as neutral for now.   What are the things around you that you find pleasing, just by looking at them? What is displeasing, just from looking? Move from object to object, and notice the small differences in *vedan\u0101* between each object. Tune in to these subtle differences.   Spend some time labelling the *vedan\u0101* associated with seeing.  ---  Take a listen to the sounds in your environment.   Which of them are pleasant? Even if there is very subtle enjoyment, notice that.   Which of the sounds are unpleasant, even in the most subtle way?   Notice how *vedan\u0101* changes from object to object.   Notice how some objects seem to have no *vedan\u0101*. Label those as neutral and move on.   Don't get stuck on any one experience.   Spend some time labelling the *vedan\u0101* associated with hearing.  ---  Tune into the smells in your environment.   Even subtle smells can have very strong *vedan\u0101*.   And strong smells can have very weak *vedan\u0101*.  Which smells are pleasing to you? Which ones are displeasing? Which smells are you indifferent to?  Spend some time labelling the *vedan\u0101* associated with smelling.  ---  When you have something in your mouth to eat or drink, pay attention to the pleasantness or unpleasantness of every flavour.   It's normal that flavours that you like will invoke *sukha vedan\u0101*.   It's normal that flavours that you dislike will be associated with *dukkha vedan\u0101*.   Pay attention to all the *vedan\u0101* when you are tasting.   Spend some time labelling the *vedan\u0101* associated with tasting.  ---  Tune into bodily experience.  From the top of your head to the tips of your toes, there are a wealth of physical sensations to experience, and each one has associated *vedan\u0101*.  Notice all the physical sensations in your face.   Some of them may be unpleasant, like a tight brow or tightness around the eyes.   Some of them may feel good, like smiling cheeks or the lips.   Many of them will be neutral. Note them as such.   Move your awareness through your body, noticing the comfort or discomfort associated with every tangible sensation.   Notice how, when the *vedan\u0101* is neutral, the tendency is to ignore the experience. Pay special attention to those experiences.   Keep notice *vedan\u0101* everywhere in your body, wherever you put your attention.   Spend some time labelling the *vedan\u0101* associated with physical feelings.  ---  Now we come to the mind. Pay attention to all the mental phenomena that you experience.   Notice the general mood of mind, the colour of the sky, so to speak. Does that have pleasant, unpleasant or neutral *vedan\u0101*?  Notice how some thoughts are comfortable, some are extremely uncomfortable. Some are totally neutral. IN any case, note the *vedan\u0101*.   It's strange how we often like to ruminate on thoughts, even those with strong dukkha *vedan\u0101*.  Think of somebody or something that you really don't like. Notice the discomfort in the mind. There is disliking because of the unpleasant *vedan\u0101*.  We'll explore this in more detail shortly.   Can you bring a thought to mind which immediately creates pleasant *vedan\u0101*?  Just think of something or somebody that you love. The reason you love that is because of the associated pleasant *vedan\u0101*. Not the other way around.     Keep noticing a world of *vedan\u0101* in the mind.   Spend some time labelling the *vedan\u0101* associated with mental phenomena.  --- Come back to open awareness, naturally occurring experiences.   Keep paying attention to the *vedan\u0101* of every prominent experience, especially as you change posture later and move around. Keep noting the three types of *vedan\u0101*.  ---  This is the *satipa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na* practice of *ved\u0101nupassan\u0101*, following the *vedan\u0101* of every experience and using that as a basis to sustain your mindfulness.   If you keep paying attention to *vedan\u0101*, you will be rewarded for your efforts with some extremely pleasant physical and mental experiences. Even in that case, don't get distracted, keep noting that this is just pleasant *vedan\u0101*.   ---  If you ever get tired of the analysis, notice the *dukkha-vedan\u0101* which are present in the mind. That's what you really are disliking. Nevertheless, give yourself a rest if needed, just come back to knowing the experiences themselves, and let your energy gather there. Once you are ready, start noting the *vedan\u0101* of every experience again.   ---  Build up your stamina, to be able to do this exercise for longer and longer, until eventually you can sustain this awareness of *vedan\u0101* throughout the day.   ---  Every single experience has *vedan\u0101*. This exercise will help you tune into this subtle world of experience and become sensitised to that.   These subtle aspects of experience are very often below the level of conscious experience for most people. You could say subliminal or subconscious. What we're practising here is to bring them up into the light of conscious awareness.  Doing this will allow you to see what you're really responding to and reacting to. Never the world out there. Everyone and everything that you like and dislike, love and hate is in response to these subtle *vedan\u0101*, these are are the true masters of your whole life.

The response mentioned here is craving, in P\u0101\u1e37i ta\u1e47h\u0101, in Sanskrit t\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101, literally 'thirst'. Used figuratively in this context, it represents the insatiable quality of desire. But desire is just one type of response, aversion is another, and indifference the third common response. Liking, disliking and couldn't care less. </p> <p>This is neatly summed up by the awakened nun Dhammadinn\u0101 in the Majjhima Nik\u0101ya.</p> <p>sukh\u0101ya kho, \u0101vuso vis\u0101kha, vedan\u0101ya r\u0101g\u0101nusayo anuseti, dukkh\u0101ya vedan\u0101ya pa\u1e6digh\u0101nusayo anuseti, adukkhamasukh\u0101ya vedan\u0101ya avijj\u0101nusayo anuset\u012b'ti. </p> <p>Comfortable vedan\u0101 have the underlying tendency toward desire. Uncomfortable vedan\u0101 have the underlying tendency toward aversion. Neither-comfortable-nor-uncomfortable vedan\u0101 have the underlying tendency toward ignorance. </p> <p>MN44 c\u016b\u1e37avedallasutta\u1e43</p> <p>You will immediately notice that 'desire, aversion and ignorance' is just another way of saying that the habitual response to vedan\u0101 is greed, hatred and delusion. </p> <p>You have very little control of what type of vedan\u0101 arises in response to any experience, mostly it is conditioned by a lifetime of previous experiences and responses. And how you respond to the vedan\u0101 is even more automatic. You will almost always respond to pleasantness with want and desire. You will almost always respond to unpleasantness with aversion and repulsion. And you will almost always respond to neutral vedan\u0101 with indifference, simply ignoring what is occurring, effectively not knowing and not understanding what is happening. That is the definition of ignorance. </p> <p>You may think you are an autonomous human being with free will and the choice to respond to life's experiences as you wish, but mostly you are a puppet of vedan\u0101. The push and pull of these subtle feelings in the mind exert the most powerful control over your entire existence. This is some very deep programming that cannot be overcome with mere theoretical understanding or wishful thinking. </p> <p>So what's the solution to this deeply ingrained patterning?</p> <p>sukh\u0101ya, bhikkhave, vedan\u0101ya r\u0101g\u0101nusayo pah\u0101tabbo, dukkh\u0101ya vedan\u0101ya pa\u1e6digh\u0101nusayo pah\u0101tabbo, adukkhamasukh\u0101ya vedan\u0101ya avijj\u0101nusayo pah\u0101tabbo. </p> <p>yato kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno sukh\u0101ya vedan\u0101ya r\u0101g\u0101nusayo pah\u012bno hoti, dukkh\u0101ya vedan\u0101ya pa\u1e6digh\u0101nusayo pah\u012bno hoti, adukkhamasukh\u0101ya vedan\u0101ya avijj\u0101nusayo pah\u012bno hoti, aya\u1e43 vuccati, bhikkhave, bhikkhu niranusayo sammaddaso acchecchi ta\u1e47ha\u1e43, vivattayi sa\u1e43yojana\u1e43, samm\u0101 m\u0101n\u0101bhisamay\u0101 antamak\u0101si dukkhass\u0101'ti.</p> <p>In the case of comfortable vedan\u0101, the underlying tendency towards desire should be abandoned.

Be aware of whatever sense experience is happening right now.  Is the experience comfortable, uncomfortable, or neither. Label it as such.   The habitual reaction to comfortable experience is to like it, to want more of it. Now you're actively going to cultivate a different reaction to pleasant experiences, that is non-reaction, just knowing it with equanimity.   The habitual reaction to uncomfortable experience is to dislike it, to want less of it, make it go away. Now you're actively going to cultivate a different reaction to unpleasant experiences, that is non-reaction, just knowing it with equanimity.   The habitual reaction to neither comfortable nor uncomfortable experience is to ignore it, to be unaware of it. Now you're actively going to cultivate a different reaction to these neutral experiences, that is non-reaction, just knowing it with equanimity.  ---  When seeing, as fast as you can blink, respond to pleasant, unpleasant and neutral *vedan\u0101* with equanimity, just experiencing them with a balanced mind.   When hearing, as fast as you can snap your fingers, respond to pleasant, unpleasant and neutral *vedan\u0101* with equanimity, just experiencing them with a balanced mind.   When smelling, as fast as water rolls off a lotus leaf, respond to pleasant, unpleasant and neutral *vedan\u0101* with equanimity, just experiencing them with a balanced mind.   When tasting, as fast as you can spit something out, respond to pleasant, unpleasant and neutral *vedan\u0101* with equanimity, just experiencing them with a balanced mind.   When feeling physical sensations, as fast as you can bend your arm, respond to pleasant, unpleasant and neutral *vedan\u0101* with equanimity, just experiencing them with a balanced mind.   When experiencing mental phenomena, as fast as a drop of water evaporates on a hot plate, respond to pleasant, unpleasant and neutral *vedan\u0101* with equanimity, just experiencing them with a balanced mind.   Experience by experience, it makes no different which sense channel the experience is occurring on, it makes no different whether it is comfortable, uncomfortable or neutral, your job is to know it in the most balanced way possible, just looking on with equanimity.   Knowing every *vedan\u0101*, respond to every one with a completely balanced mind.  ---  When experiencing pleasant *vedan\u0101*, don't give craving a chance. Don't let desire take root. Keep the mind balanced in response.   When experiencing unpleasant *vedan\u0101*, don't give aversion a chance. Don't let dislike take root. Keep the mind balanced in response.   When experiencing neutral *vedan\u0101*, don't give ignorance a chance. Don't let delusion take root. Keep the mind balanced in response.   ---  This is the most simple yet profound practice to alter the way you respond to reality.   Not having each and every experience coloured and clouded by greed, hatred and delusion will allow you to see more clearly, more objectively, more in line with reality.   ---  The practice is simple, but maintaining it is difficult. So make a special effort to continue throughout the day and into the night, knowing each experience, fully experiencing each *phassa*, every *vedan\u0101* with a non-reactive mind.   This is the noble practice of *indriyabh\u0101van\u0101*, cultivating equanimity to each and every experience.   ---  Keep knowing every experience and responding with perfect mental balance.   Experience by experience, it is possible to change this deeply ingrained pattern of response.   Don't be a slave of *vedan\u0101* any longer. Don't let this invisible force exert its hidden power over you. Instead of responding to *vedan\u0101* with greed, with hatred, with delusion, responded with a perfectly calm, balanced mind.   This is the training in cultivating equanimity. Keep practising.     <p>Next</p>"},{"location":"4.01%20Emptiness.html","title":"4.01 Emptiness","text":"<p>At last we come to the heart of the matter. </p> <p>cakkhu att\u0101\u2019ti yo vadeyya ta\u1e43 na upapajjati. cakkhussa upp\u0101dopi vayopi pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101yati. yassa kho pana upp\u0101dopi vayopi pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101yati, \u2018att\u0101 me uppajjati ca veti c\u0101\u2019ti iccassa evam\u0101gata\u1e43 hoti. tasm\u0101 ta\u1e43 na upapajjati \u2013 \u2018cakkhu att\u0101\u2019ti yo vadeyya. iti cakkhu anatt\u0101.</p> <p>Whoever says, \"I am the eye / The eye is me\", that is unacceptable.

Therefore it is unacceptable to say \"I am the eye / The eye is me\". The eye is impersonal.</p> <p>MN 148 chachakkasutta\u1e43</p> <p>By the same logic, the sutta goes on to discuss every aspect of six sense experience from the same logic. </p> <p>Whoever says, \"I am visible forms / visible forms are me\" ... </p> <p>Whoever says, \"I am eye consciousness / eye consciousness is me\" ... </p> <p>Whoever says, \"I am visual experience / visual experience is me\" ...</p> <p>Whoever says, \"I am vedan\u0101 / vedan\u0101 is me\" ...</p> <p>Whoever says, \"I am craving / craving is me\", that is unacceptable. The coming into being and disappearance of the craving is evident. Then one would have to conclude, \"I am coming into being and disappearing\". Therefore it is unacceptable to say \"I am craving / craving is me\". Craving is impersonal.</p> <p>What is this sutta emphasising? If the process of experience is entirely made out of parts, and all those parts are dependent on each other, then it's impossible for one of the parts to be some kind of permanent essence or Self. And yet, this is exactly what we believe. It doesn't matter if you come from an Abrahamic religion and believe in a soul, or follow Hindu ideas and believe in a Higher Self, or even be a scientific atheist with no belief. Still, we almost all believe and acts as if there's a self right here in experience, an experiencer if you will. Nobody even questions the validity of this belief, it seems to be a self-evident truth. But when you analyse experience, subjectively or objectively, it turns out to be a false idea, an unfounded belief. </p> <p>We consider ourselves to be rational human beings, and yet this magical belief of an experiencing self persists, despite all evidence to the contrary. There certainly is the illusion of a continuous self that's experiencing the objective material world, and having this inner subjective experience, but when you zoom into experience, you can clearly see it is made out of component parts, and that there's no self hiding within any of the parts, or outside the parts. </p> <p>Without any investigation, almost all of us take consciousness to be some kind of continuous entity, our true being. \"Sure consciousness keeps changing,\" one might say, \"yet I'm still the same person\". But if you put consciousness under the spotlight, it becomes obvious that it is completely dependent on things which are very clearly not oneself, leading to the ridiculous situation mentioned in the sutta above, where one's self must be arising and passing away on the whims of impersonal external objects. </p> <p>The other thing which we really take to be our self are our wishes, wants, desires and loves. And on the opposite side, our dislikes, grudges, grievances and hatreds. Even the smallest preferences are taken as part of oneself. Nothing could be more personal than what one loves and hates, surely? And yet an investigation of vedan\u0101 clearly shows that all one's likes and dislikes are based on the impersonal push and pull of feelings in the mind which arise due to their own causes and conditions. So even our personal desires turn out to be highly impersonal and conditioned by external forces. </p> <p>Another important point that becomes clear from examining experience is this: the world that we all think of as 'out there' turns out to be a very much constructed 'in here'. There is no way to separate the visual form 'out there', from the eye that sees and the consciousness that knows it is seeing. All of its beauty and ugliness turns out to the result of vedan\u0101 within one's mind, not qualities of the world outside. The experience is full of colour and shapes, but completely empty of the one thing that matters, a self, an I, a me, mine, anything that can belong to a self.</p> <p>This is precisely the question Ananda asks the Buddha about in this sutta from the Sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-sa\u1e43yutta in the Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya. </p> <p>su\u00f1\u00f1o loko, su\u00f1\u00f1o loko\u2019ti, bhante, vuccati. kitt\u0101vat\u0101 nu kho, bhante, su\u00f1\u00f1o lokoti vuccat'ti? </p> <p>yasm\u0101 ca kho, \u0101nanda, su\u00f1\u00f1a\u1e43 attena v\u0101 attaniyena v\u0101 tasm\u0101 su\u00f1\u00f1o lokoti vuccati. </p> <p>ki\u00f1ca, \u0101nanda, su\u00f1\u00f1a\u1e43 attena v\u0101 attaniyena v\u0101? cakkhu kho, \u0101nanda, su\u00f1\u00f1a\u1e43 attena v\u0101 attaniyena v\u0101. r\u016bp\u0101 su\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 attena v\u0101 attaniyena v\u0101, cakkhuvi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a\u1e43 su\u00f1\u00f1a\u1e43 attena v\u0101 attaniyena v\u0101, cakkhusamphasso su\u00f1\u00f1o attena v\u0101 attaniyena v\u0101,yampida\u1e43 cakkhusamphassapaccay\u0101 uppajjati vedayita\u1e43 sukha\u1e43 v\u0101 dukkha\u1e43 v\u0101 adukkhamasukha\u1e43 tampi su\u00f1\u00f1a\u1e43 attena v\u0101 attaniyena v\u0101.</p> <p>Bhante, it is said, \"The world is empty, the world is empty. In what way is the world empty?\"</p> <p>Because, Ananda, the world is empty of a self or anything related to a self, that's why it is said, \"The world is empty.\"</p> <p>And what is empty of a self or anything related to a self? The eye... forms ... eye consciousness... visual experience... all that is felt, pleasant or unpleasant, based on visual experience, that too is is empty of a self or anything related to a self. </p> <p>(And likewise for all the other senses including mind)</p> <p>SN35.85 su\u00f1\u00f1atalokasutta\u1e43</p> <p>The first thing to notice about this sutta is that the Buddha describes the world not as the world 'out there', but as the subjective world of experience. That's the only world anybody actually knows. And while this world is full of experiential phenomena, it's truly empty of a self, empty of any essence, empty of any entity, empty of any soul, empty of any kind of lasting being. </p> <p>This idea of emptiness can really freak some people out. They think, \"Before I had an I, now it doesn't seem to exist any more. Where did I go!? What happened to me!?\" But there never was an I, there never was a me, it was always just empty experience. Others leap towards this idea of emptiness, because they understand the simple truth of it. This is what's happening now, this is what's always been happening, just empty experience arising and passing away. When nothing to hold on to, the mind can let go. </p> <p>sabbe dhamm\u0101 anatt\u0101'ti, yad\u0101 pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101ya passati, atha nibbindati dukkhe, esa maggo visuddhiy\u0101.</p> <p>All phenomena are impersonal, when one sees this with wisdom, then one becomes dis-enchanted with suffering, this is the path to purification. </p> <p>DHP20 Dhammpada verse 279</p> <p>This verse from the Dhammapada highlights the point. We are so enchanted by the idea of a self that we end up clinging onto impersonal experiences as I, me, mine, mistaking them to be a self. Ultimately, clinging onto something that isn't really one's own to possess just causes endless amounts of hardship and suffering. </p> <p>When you see this with the eye of wisdom, how all things inside and outside are completely impersonal, the illusion breaks. You see that dragging an imaginary self and all its possessions around is a huge burden, an unnecessary stress.

Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and said to him:</p> <p>\"Venerable sir, a new assembly hall has recently been built here for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu and it has not yet been inhabited by any recluse or brahmin or human being at all. Venerable sir, let the Blessed One be the first to use it. When the Blessed One has used it first, then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu will use it afterwards. That will lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time.\"</p> <p>The Blessed One consented in silence. Then, when they saw that he had consented, they got up from their seats, and after paying homage to him, keeping him on their right, they went to the assembly hall. They covered it completely with coverings and prepared seats, and they put out a large water jug and hung up an oil-lamp. Then they went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, they stood at one side and said:</p> <p>\"Venerable sir, the assembly hall has been covered completely with coverings and seats have been prepared, a large water jug has been put out and an oil-lamp hung up. Let the Blessed One come at his own convenience.\"</p> <p>Then the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he went with the Sa\u1e45gha of bhikkhus to the assembly hall. When he arrived, he washed his feet and then entered the hall and sat down by the central pillar facing the east. And the bhikkhus washed their feet and then entered the hall and sat down by the western wall facing the east, with the Blessed One before them. And the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu washed their feet and entered the hall and sat down by the eastern wall facing the west, with the Blessed One before them.</p> <p>Then, when the Blessed One had instructed, urged, roused, and gladdened the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu with talk on the Dhamma for much of the night, he said to the venerable \u0100nanda:</p> <p>\"\u0100nanda, speak to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu about the disciple in higher training who has entered upon the way. My back is uncomfortable. I will rest it.\"</p> <p>\"Yes, venerable sir,\" the venerable \u0100nanda replied.</p> <p>Then the Blessed One prepared his patchwork cloak folded in four and lay down on his right side in the lion's pose, with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and fully aware, after noting in his mind the time for rising.</p> <p>Then the venerable \u0100nanda addressed Mah\u0101n\u0101ma the Sakyan thus:</p> <p>\"Mah\u0101n\u0101ma, here a noble disciple is possessed of virtue, guards the doors of his sense faculties, is moderate in eating, and devoted to wakefulness; he possesses seven good qualities; and he is one who obtains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jh\u0101nas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now.</p> <p>\"And how is a noble disciple possessed of virtue? Here a noble disciple is virtuous, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the P\u0101timokkha, he is perfect in conduct and resort, and seeing fear in the slightest fault, he trains by undertaking the training precepts. This is how a noble disciple is possessed of virtue.</p> <p>\"And how does a noble disciple guard the doors of his sense faculties? On seeing a form with the eye, a noble disciple does not grasp at its signs and features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him, he practises the way of its restraint, he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear \u2026 On smelling an odour with the nose \u2026 On tasting a flavour with the tongue \u2026 On touching a tangible with the body \u2026 on cognizing a mind-object with the mind, a noble disciple does not grasp at its signs and features. Since, if he left the mind faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him, he practises the way of its restraint, he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty. That is how a noble disciple guards the doors of his sense faculties.</p> <p>\"And how is a noble disciple moderate in eating? Here, reflecting wisely, a noble disciple takes food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the endurance and continuance of this body, for ending discomfort, and for assisting the holy life, considering: \u2018Thus I shall terminate old feelings without arousing new feelings and I shall be healthy and blameless and shall live in comfort.\u2019 That is how a noble disciple is moderate in eating.</p> <p>\"And how is a noble disciple devoted to wakefulness? Here, during the day, while walking back and forth and sitting, a noble disciple purifies his mind of obstructive states. In the first watch of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind of obstructive states. In the middle watch of the night he lies down on the right side in the lion's pose with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and fully aware, after noting in his mind the time for rising. After rising, in the third watch of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind of obstructive states. That is how a noble disciple is devoted to wakefulness.</p> <p>\"And how does a noble disciple possess seven good qualities? Here a noble disciple has faith; he places his faith in the Tath\u0101gata's enlightenment thus: \u2018The Blessed One is accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.\u2019</p> <p>\"He has shame; he is ashamed of misconduct in body, speech, and mind, ashamed of engaging in evil unwholesome deeds.</p> <p>\"He has fear of wrongdoing; he is afraid of misconduct in body, speech, and mind, afraid of engaging in evil unwholesome deeds.</p> <p>\"He has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and consolidates what he has learned. Such teachings as are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, and affirm a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure \u2014 such teachings as these he has learned much of, remembered, recited verbally, investigated with the mind and penetrated well by view.</p> <p>\"He is energetic in abandoning unwholesome states and in undertaking wholesome states; he is steadfast, firm in striving, not remiss in developing wholesome states.</p> <p>\"He has mindfulness; he possesses the highest mindfulness and skill; he recalls and recollects what was done long ago and spoken long ago.</p> <p>\"He is wise; he possesses wisdom regarding rise and disappearance that is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. That is how a noble disciple possesses seven good qualities.</p> <p>\"And how is a noble disciple one who obtains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jh\u0101nas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now? Here, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a noble disciple enters upon and abides in the first jh\u0101na \u2026 With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he enters upon and abides in the second jh\u0101na \u2026 With the fading away as well of rapture \u2026 he enters upon and abides in the third jh\u0101na \u2026 With the abandoning of pleasure and pain \u2026 he enters upon and abides in the fourth jh\u0101na, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. That is how a noble disciple is one who obtains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jh\u0101nas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now.</p> <p>\"When a noble disciple has thus become one who is possessed of virtue, who guards the doors of his sense faculties, who is moderate in eating, who is devoted to wakefulness, who possesses seven good qualities, who obtains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jh\u0101nas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now, he is called one in higher training who has entered upon the way. His eggs are unspoiled; he is capable of breaking out, capable of enlightenment, capable of attaining the supreme security from bondage.</p> <p>\"Suppose there were a hen with eight or ten or twelve eggs, which she had covered, incubated, and nurtured properly. Even though she did not wish: \u2018Oh, that my chicks might pierce their shells with the points of their claws and beaks and hatch out safely!\u2019 yet the chicks are capable of piercing their shells with the points of their claws and beaks and hatching out safely. So too, when a noble disciple has thus become one who is possessed of virtue \u2026 he is called one in higher training who has entered upon the way. His eggs are unspoiled; he is capable of breaking out, capable of enlightenment, capable of attaining the supreme security from bondage.</p> <p>\"Based upon that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is due to equanimity, this noble disciple recollects his manifold past lives \u2026 Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives. This is his first breaking out like that of the hen's chicks from their shells.</p> <p>\"Based upon that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is due to equanimity, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, this noble disciple sees beings passing away and reappearing \u2026 he understands how beings pass on according to their actions. This is his second breaking out like that of the hen's chicks from their shells.</p> <p>\"Based upon that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is due to equanimity, by realising for himself with direct knowledge, this noble disciple here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints. This is his third breaking out like that of the hen's chicks from their shells.</p> <p>\"When a noble disciple is possessed of virtue, that pertains to his conduct. When he guards the doors of his sense faculties, that pertains to his conduct. When he is moderate in eating, that pertains to his conduct. When he is devoted to wakefulness, that pertains to his conduct. When he possesses seven good qualities, that pertains to his conduct. When he is one who obtains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jh\u0101nas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now, that pertains to his conduct.</p> <p>\"When he recollects his manifold past lives \u2026 with their aspects and particulars, that pertains to his true knowledge. When, with the divine eye \u2026 he sees beings passing away and reappearing and understands how beings pass on according to their actions, that pertains to his true knowledge. When, by realising for himself with direct knowledge, he here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints, that pertains to his true knowledge.</p> <p>\"This noble disciple is thus said to be perfect in true knowledge, perfect in conduct, perfect in true knowledge and conduct.</p> <p>And this stanza was uttered by the Brahm\u0101 Sanankum\u0101ra:</p> <p>\u2018The noble clan is held to be The best of people as to lineage; But best of gods and humans is one Perfect in true knowledge and conduct.\u2019</p> <p>\"Now that stanza was well sung by the Brahm\u0101 Sanankum\u0101ra, not ill sung; it was well spoken, not ill spoken; it has a meaning, and is not meaningless; and it was approved by the Blessed One.\"</p> <p>Then the Blessed One rose and addressed the venerable \u0100nanda thus: \"Good, good, \u0100nanda! It is good that you have spoken to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu about the disciple in higher training who has entered upon the way.\"</p> <p>That is what the venerable \u0100nanda said.

When he harbours aversion towards painful feeling, the underlying tendency to aversion towards painful feeling lies behind this.

Because the uninstructed worldling does not know of any escape from painful feeling other than sensual pleasure. When he seeks delight in sensual pleasure, the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling lies behind this. He does not understand as it really is the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of these feelings.

If he feels a painful feeling, he feels it attached. If he feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he feels it attached.

Here, \u0100nanda, when a bhikkhu sees a form with the eye, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He understands thus: \u2018There has arisen in me what is agreeable, there has arisen what is disagreeable, there has arisen what is both agreeable and disagreeable. But that is conditioned, gross, dependently arisen; this is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, equanimity.\u2019 The agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease in him and equanimity is established. Just as a man with good sight, having opened his eyes might shut them or having shut his eyes might open them, so too concerning anything at all, the agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly, just as rapidly, just as easily, and equanimity is established.

He understands thus: \u2026 and equanimity is established. Just as a strong man might easily snap his fingers, so too concerning anything at all, the agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly, just as rapidly, just as easily, and equanimity is established. This is called in the Noble One's Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding sounds cognizable by the ear.</p> <p>\"Again, \u0100nanda, when a bhikkhu smells an odour with the nose, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He understands thus: \u2026 and equanimity is established. Just as raindrops on a slightly sloping lotus leaf roll off and do not remain there, so too concerning anything at all, the agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly, just as rapidly, just as easily, and equanimity is established. This is called in the Noble One's Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding odours cognizable by the nose.</p> <p>\"Again, \u0100nanda, when a bhikkhu tastes a flavour with the tongue, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He understands thus: \u2026 and equanimity is established. Just as a strong man might easily spit out a ball of spittle collected on the tip of his tongue, so too concerning anything at all, the agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly, just as rapidly, just as easily, and equanimity is established. This is called in the Noble One's Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding flavours cognizable by the tongue.</p> <p>\"Again, \u0100nanda, when a bhikkhu touches a tangible with the body, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable.

Just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, so too concerning anything at all, the agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly, just as rapidly, just as easily, and equanimity is established. This is called in the Noble One's Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding tangibles cognizable by the body.</p> <p>\"Again, \u0100nanda, when a bhikkhu cognizes a mind-object with the mind, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He understands thus: \u2026 and equanimity is established. Just as if a man were to let two or three drops of water fall onto an iron plate heated for a whole day, the falling of the drops might be slow but they would quickly vaporise and vanish, so too concerning anything at all, the agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly, just as rapidly, just as easily, and equanimity is established. This is called in the Noble One's Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding ideas cognizable by the mind.</p> <p>\"That is how there is the supreme development of the faculties in the Noble One's Discipline.</p> <p>\"And how, \u0100nanda, is one a disciple in higher training, one who has entered upon the way?

If he should wish: \u2018May I abide perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,\u2019 he abides perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive. If he should wish: \u2018May I abide perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive, \u2019 he abides perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive. If he should wish: \u2018May I abide perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive,\u2019 he abides perceiving the unrepulsive in that. If he should wish: \u2018May I abide perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,\u2019 he abides perceiving the repulsive in that.

Whatever mood you're in is just \"mind channel\". </p> <p>the experience might be in a different field no problem just you just follow whatever attention prsents to you. wherever the mind goes, just follow. the mind has been doing this for as long as you've been alive. how to do this now you're just watching what the mind does so that you can learn from it understand it. to build understanding all you have to do at this stage is know very briefly what channel the experiences happening on, this is seeing, this is hearing, this is smelling, this is tasting, this is physical experience, this is mental experience, that's all. and stay with the experience note the channel that's enough for now. if knowing the channel is difficult then at very least stay with the experience. </p> <p>for some people this comes very naturally for other people it's an uphill battle from the word go. get the benefits its good. always useful things that come from this practice, every little bit of self understanding helps you to improve knowing yourself better. there's no disadvantage to knowing how you work how the mind works how this body works. on this the sense fields work is not disadvantage denying that advantage and further advantageous in every single possible way.</p> <p>your biggest challenge in the beginning is you're going to default to thinking and planning daydreaming memory memories are you going to go to the mind and do not going to know that you've gone to the mind as soon as you become aware note that this is mental experience. that's helps to give you just one step back, get a little bit of perspective. that's the most common default pattern with modern human beings is to go into the thought world and not actually know that you're in thought, just be so absorbed in the story that you're not aware that it's just a story. so this is the most important ground level practice this is the practice that you need to be able to default to at all times that is the foundation for everything which follows if you need to spend more time here spend as much time as you need to get a good foundation is really really important you don't need to build a perfect foundation you just need to have a basic awareness of what is happening and the further steps will help you to develop a more solid funded foundation. so don't think you need to do this perfectly even monks with twenty years of meditation experience are not perfect everyday, but good enough to to see what's happening that's that's enough of a basis for going deeper into the buddha's teachings on sa\u1e37\u0101yatana so if you need to spend a day here spend a few days, spend a week. if you need to but don't don't get stuck here this this way but wait there's more, there's so much more but this is a necessary foundation a necessary prerequisite. it's also something that can be done throughout the day in daily life this is something that you can really bring into your life at all times there are some times where you have to fully engage with thinking while doing some work when interacting with other people but there's a lot of free time to sit and notice expereince. and using all your free time and my free time i mean eating time washing time toilet time brushing teeth time drinking time walking time all of these kind of less important activities you can be practicing open awareness.  the main thing is this practice doesn't need to be done in a sitting posture it can be done in any posture setting lying standing walking sitting lying down moving sitting still stretching anything in between. experience is always happening irrespective of what posture the body is in. so don't think this needs to be done in lotus position. my favorite is walking meditation. take this meditation and go for a solitary nature walk. its to wonderful wonderful way to get some fresh air, good exercise and get some good mental exercise as well. you could expand this into a little section how to walk in nature. each one of these is heading and paragraph,  heading and a paragraph. and then over time you'll build up but if content on each one.  is it then you can put your paragraphs into some kind of structure</p>"},{"location":"xxx%20Notes%20to%20process.html#one-at-a-time","title":"One at a time","text":"<p>The inner experience seems so rich and complex, so it might be surprising to learn that the mind can only take one object of experience at a time.

You should really try this meditation method, which is found in ancient P\u0101\u1e37i texts\".

That's a long journey from where we are right now, but know that this is where the practice goes. </p> <p>So let's practice the meditation on emptiness to lighten the load.</p> <p>Someone came to the Buddha and asked him how to know when the job is done, the training is complete.  </p> <p>\"katamo ca, bhikkhave, pariy\u0101yo, ya\u1e43 pariy\u0101ya\u1e43 \u0101gamma bhikkhu a\u00f1\u00f1atreva saddh\u0101ya\u2026pe\u2026 a\u00f1\u00f1atra di\u1e6d\u1e6dhinijjh\u0101nakkhantiy\u0101 a\u00f1\u00f1a\u1e43 by\u0101karoti \u2013 kh\u012b\u1e47\u0101 j\u0101ti, vusita\u1e43 brahmacariya\u1e43, kata\u1e43 kara\u1e47\u012bya\u1e43, n\u0101para\u1e43 itthatt\u0101y\u0101ti paj\u0101n\u0101m\u012b\u2019ti? idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu cakkhun\u0101 r\u016bpa\u1e43 disv\u0101 santa\u1e43 v\u0101 ajjhatta\u1e43 r\u0101gadosamoha\u1e43, atthi me ajjhatta\u1e43 r\u0101gadosamohoti paj\u0101n\u0101ti, asanta\u1e43 v\u0101 ajjhatta\u1e43 r\u0101gadosamoha\u1e43, natthi me ajjhatta\u1e43 r\u0101gadosamohoti paj\u0101n\u0101ti. ya\u1e43 ta\u1e43, bhikkhave, bhikkhu cakkhun\u0101 r\u016bpa\u1e43 disv\u0101 santa\u1e43 v\u0101 ajjhatta\u1e43 r\u0101gadosamoha\u1e43, atthi me ajjhatta\u1e43 r\u0101gadosamohoti paj\u0101n\u0101ti, asanta\u1e43 v\u0101 ajjhatta\u1e43 r\u0101gadosamoha\u1e43, natthi me ajjhatta\u1e43 r\u0101gadosamohoti paj\u0101n\u0101ti. api nume, bhikkhave, dhamm\u0101 saddh\u0101ya v\u0101 veditabb\u0101, ruciy\u0101 v\u0101 veditabb\u0101, anussavena v\u0101 veditabb\u0101, \u0101k\u0101raparivitakkena v\u0101 veditabb\u0101, di\u1e6d\u1e6dhinijjh\u0101nakkhantiy\u0101 v\u0101 veditabb\u0101\"ti?</p> <p>xxx translation</p> <p>SN35.153 atthinukhopariy\u0101yasutta\u1e43</p>"},{"location":"xxx%20Unravelling%20patterns.html","title":"xxx Unravelling patterns","text":""},{"location":"xxx%20Unravelling%20patterns.html#breaking-the-chain","title":"Breaking the chain","text":"<p>Over the duration of this course, we've built up a framework of concepts that the Buddha found useful for examining subjective experience.

How else to create lasting change?</p> <p>Certainly, some techniques may create a temporary change, but mostly they they don't last, and eventually you slip back into old patterns of thought and behaviour. </p> <p>This is a very slow and reliable method, which requires nothing more than willingness to learn and attention. </p>"},{"location":"xxx%20Unravelling%20patterns.html#what-is-your-current-situation","title":"What is your current situation","text":"<p>What does your current situation? As you receive input through the six senses, you respond with very strong preference and aversion to the most subtle stimuli. Even the smallest experience can completely throw you off kilter. Then you respond to people and situations inappropriately, which creates more stimulus, and so there's an ongoing cycle of being slightly off-balance all the time. </p> <p>This practice presents an opportunity to know the smallest details of what you're experiencing, to have a very balanced mind in response to each and every one of those experiences, to respond calmly and appropriately, or not at all, as the case may be, as opposed to being pushed around, forced around, bullied by vedan\u0101 all the time. </p> <p>This practice offers an opportunity to have a balanced mind and respond appropriately to normal stimulus. The net result is a decrease in suffering, a decrease in difficult situations which you've created through ill-formed responses, and an increase in pleasant life situations created by skilful responses. </p>"},{"location":"xxx%20Unravelling%20patterns.html#how-to-alter-reality","title":"How to alter reality","text":"<p>What we call reality is nothing more than the subjective experience of the five senses and the mind. Apart from that, what else has anyone ever known?</p> <p>The practice of returning to sense experience alters reality and reshapes the subjective world we live in for the better. The simple act of changing subjective experience changes the only reality you actually know.</p> <p>The normal way most people attempt to alter reality is by changing the material world out there. That is, of course, a viable option, but outside the scope of this course. </p> <p>We're going to look at three internal ways of altering reality based on an understanding of how the senses work. </p> <ol> <li>change the object of experience</li> <li>change the reaction to the object of experience. </li> <li>change the understanding of the structure of experience itself </li> </ol> <p>The corollary of the mind only experiencing one thing at a time is that you can really change your life experience by simply changing what the mind rests its attention on. If you stop feeding the mind unwholesome objects, feed it more wholesome ones, and learn to sustain attention on them, you can dramatically alter your own subjective reality, and enjoy all the rewards of that.^[Testing out online footnotes]</p> <p>If the object of awareness is causing you suffering, you can learn to change the object. An example is the experience of ruminating on a painful thought. Simply moving attention to the body effectively removes the thought from experience. You cannot hold a painful thought and the vivid experience of the body in the mind at the same moment. There's no need to continue letting the mind experience whatever it wants and creating unhappiness for yourself.</p> <p>The second method suggested offers a deeper solution to the problem of suffering, but still not a permanent one. In many cases, it is preferable to face the reality of something painful. In those situations we cannot alter the outside world immediately, we cannot change the experience, but we can alter our response to the experience. This is a profound topic which will be looked at in more detail in the section on Vedan\u0101 xxx. </p> <p>But both of the above are temporary solutions, but the Buddha has offered a more permanent solution to the problem of suffering. This involves a radical re-assessment of the nature of experience itself, and understanding how there are structural problems in the way that we understand our own experience that are at the root of suffering. This will be discussed in much more detail later on in the Insight into sense experience xxx.</p>"},{"location":"xxx%20Unravelling%20patterns.html#differentiate-between","title":"Differentiate between","text":"<ul> <li>productive thought, goal orientated thought, working thoughts</li> <li>frivolous thought, daydreams, imagination, worry </li> <li>all the second category can be replaced with awareness of the sense fields</li> </ul> <p>There's no stress whatsoever in simple sense experience, just seeing. There's lots of stress in regretting the past, mentally churning over situations and worrying about the future. Simply by reducing the time you spend in unnecessary thought, and increasing the time you spend with the senses, you can greatly reduce your stress and enormously improve the quality of your life. But of course merely knowing this does not solve the problem, which is why we're practising here is a method to return to sense experience wherever possible, and only let the mind use thinking ability when absolutely necessary. </p> <p>Fear not! This practice will not cause you to lose the ability to think. Thinking happens automatically anyway, it's not something that you actively do. Hopefully these exercises will allow you to see that for yourself. If anything, this practice will give you more control of your mind to not be overwhelmed by incessant, invasive or negative thoughts.</p>"},{"location":"xxx%20Unravelling%20patterns.html#how-to-alter-your-reality-in-the-most-fundamental-way","title":"how to alter your reality in the most fundamental way","text":"<ul> <li>Change the object of perception </li> <li>Being with the senses is how to practice the instructions in satipa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na sutta going coming back, walking standing sitting lying down, eating, drinking talking being quiet </li> <li>stay with awareness of what's just happened at the five senses doors</li> <li>doing this habitually changes the habit pattern of the mind</li> <li>bringing it to the five senses decreases useless thinking, worrying, fantasizing, useless speculation</li> </ul>"},{"location":"xxx%20Unravelling%20patterns.html#how-to-alter-reality_1","title":"How to alter reality","text":"<p>4.01 Emptiness</p>"}]}
