# 1.01 About the Course

## Intention
My intention in preparing this course is very simple. I have benefited enormously from understanding both the theoretical and practical aspects of the Buddha's teaching on *saḷāyatana* - the six fields of sense experience. I would like to share what I have learned with you, so that you too may get the same benefit.

Compared to other frameworks found in the suttas, *saḷāyatana* is a way of entering into the Buddha's teaching that is understandable for modern (supposedly) rational humans, it is free from overt religious overtones, it requires no belief in anything unseen or supernatural, and can be experienced directly through introspection. 

*Saḷāyatana* is also uniquely relevant to the modern human condition. It reveals in vivid detail how we produce our own suffering from reactions to sense experience. Although we are surrounded by material luxury and convenience unimaginable for the average person a few centuries ago, there's no associated decrease in psychological dis-ease. In fact, the opposite is true, we live in an age of unprecedented mental stress and psychological suffering. 

This only makes the Buddha more relevant than ever before, a unique historical spiritual master who didn't teach for the ultimate goal of a pleasant afterlife, or fellowship with God Almighty in heaven, or to realise some abstract concept like the True Self. He taught that the highest goal is a practical one, to understand the causes of suffering and to end suffering in this very life.

> *pubbe cāhaṃ bhikkhave, etarahi ca dukkhañceva paññāpemi, dukkhassa ca nirodhaṃ.*  
> 
> Previously and now at present, monks, I merely teach suffering and its cessation.
> 
> *MN22 alagaddūpamasuttaṃ*

Through understanding the theory of *saḷāyatana* and putting it into practice, may you effectively reduce your psychological stress and ultimately eradicate it entirely. 

## Structure of the course
We will start with establishing mindfulness on the experience of the six senses.

Then we will examine how sense experience gets constructed, how each experience is a composite of multiple components, and the necessary conditions for any experience to arise.

Then we will investigate how each and every experience has a certain pleasant, unpleasant or neutral feeling tone, and how you are reacting to those, forming intentions, generating craving, aversion and delusion, and acting out the responses in thought word and deed.

Finally, we will look deeply into how each part of this process is stamped with the three marks of existence: impermanence, dis-ease, and the fact of being completely impersonal.

Recognising each part of the process, it is possible to slowly change habitual unskilful responses into more skilful ones.

For each step along the way, there will be

1. **Theory**: Some written words on the topic at hand discussing ideas found in suttas, and how to apply them in practice.
2. **Practice**: Guided meditation instructions to get you started on the path of introspection into the topic.
3. **Sutta Reading**: for a broader view of the topic 

## How to do this course
This course is designed for self-study and can be completed at your own pace. It can be finished in 10 days or 10 years. But, more important than rushing to complete the course is correctly grasping each level of the successive instructions and being able to put them into practice for yourself. 

**Don't move on** to the next section until you:

1. have understood the theory,
2. have listened to the guided meditation to get an idea how to put the theory into practice,
3. and are able to meditate on the current theme by yourself

## Distractions
It is highly recommended that you minimise external distractions while you are doing this course. If possible, disconnect from communication and the internet. If that is not possible, then set aside a small fixed time for communication and online activity. 

If you are addicted to some website, an app on your phone, or some form of social media, then please disable that with some kind of app blocker. Most modern people are psychologically dependent on their devices, so in the beginning it's helpful to physically remove the temptation, later on you can go back to it and face your digital addiction mindfully. 

A digital data fast is recommended so that you can effectively learn a new skill and see exactly how the mind behaves. It's too easy to lose the benefit of meditation by breaking the continuity with digital distractions. 

To get the full benefit of this course, drastically limit what is available to the senses from the outside world. This way you can get maximum return from the time you have to invest in this. 

In short, live like a monastic. 

## Subjective Experience
This course focuses entirely on subjective experience - the raw, first-person 'what it feels like' to be alive and conscious - rather than what is considered objective material reality. We all have a rich inner world of experience, from the taste of fruit juice to the feelings of joy and anguish. These experiential phenomena are private, accessible only to you, the individual experiencing them.

Science can observe correlates of conscious experience, such as EEG patterns, fMRI scans, or physiological markers like heart rate and pupil dilation. However, these are only physical processes associated with consciousness, not consciousness itself. Fortunately, we do not need to solve the "hard problem of consciousness" - why and how brain activity gives rise to subjective experience - in order to be aware of our own subjective experiences. We merely need to pay attention to them. 

The Buddha's focus on *saḷāyatana* is not for abstract knowledge or scientific understanding, but for seeing clearly how subjective experience gives rise to suffering, and how to get free from that. While neuroscience provides fascinating insights into the mechanisms of conscious experience from the 'outside', it has little to say, and offers little relief from psychological suffering happening on the 'inside'.

Throughout this course, we will talk much about 'mind' and hardly ever mention the word 'brain'. The reason for this is simple: the mind and mental processes are available to experience, whereas as the brain and its processes are invisible to subjective experience.

Even if it is outside the scope of scientific measurement, there is nothing more fundamental to being than subjective experience. For two and a half millennia, the Buddhist tradition has preserved a wealth of teachings and practical methods for working with this inner reality, mindfulness being just the tip of the iceberg. Through an open-minded engagement with the ideas and techniques, you can deepen your understanding of subjective experience and transform your relationship with it.

## The miracle of instruction
When questioned about what is the most miraculous power, the Buddha rejected psychic abilities and mind reading, and instead said that the ability to instruct another is truly the most miraculous power.

> *katamañca, kevaṭṭa, anusāsanīpāṭihāriyaṃ? idha, kevaṭṭa, bhikkhu evamanusāsati – ‘evaṃ vitakketha, mā evaṃ vitakkayittha, evaṃ manasikarotha, mā evaṃ manasākattha, idaṃ pajahatha, idaṃ upasampajja viharathā’ti.*
> 
> And what is the miracle of instruction? A monk advises in such a way, "Think like this, don't think like that. Pay attention like this, don't pay attention like that. Abandon this, and undertake and continue with that."
> 
> *DN11 kevaṭṭasuttaṃ*

It's good to remember that the early discourses of the Buddha are not presenting some philosophy or religion, a fixed idea of how the world is, or should be. The discourses are giving instructions for practice, how to think beneficially, how to avoid unskilful thought patterns, what to pay attention to, what to ignore, what to abandon and what to undertake and continue doing. When followed, these instructions lead one successively to a new understanding of reality that's not possible to reach by mere theoretical thinking, only through experiential understanding. 

So what we're attempting to do in this course is grasp the theory being taught, and, in a spirit of discovery, apply it within to see where it leads. This is not some religion to believe in, what is required is for you to put your metaphorical boots on and start walking.

# 1.02 A note on meditation

## What is meant by meditation?
When we talk about meditation, what do we mean? What's the mind doing in meditation? Many people have the image, contrary to their own experience, of a totally tranquil mind cleared off all thoughts, blissfully experiencing some sublime reality. And while that it is certainly one possible result of meditation, it doesn't come close to describing the range of activities that fall under the heading of meditation. 

The English word 'meditation' is a translation of many different Pāḷi words, which are applicable in different contexts. The most common word translated as meditation is *bhāvanā*. Literally it means "causing to be", more figuratively it can be rendered as 'development' or 'cultivation'. Implicit is the sense that, just like a farmer cannot make crops grow directly, but can supply all the necessary conditions for the cultivation of a field, we too cannot directly make the mind be a certain way, but we can provide the necessary conditions for mental cultivation, maturation and development. 

There are many different activities that constitute *bhāvanā*. These include restraining the mind from certain harmful activities, cultivating beneficial perceptions to see things in a new light, actively thinking and reflecting on certain themes, non-judgemental awareness of phenomena as they are, and giving the deepest attention to the characteristics of experience. These are just some of the mediation activities described in the oldest Buddhist texts. 

Another word often translated as meditation is *jhāna*, which refers to very specific stages of development that are common when practising meditation. The stages of *jhāna* are a natural result of correctly practised *bhāvanā*. It's like if different people are given directions to the same destination, they will all pass the same landmarks and features along the way, although each person will see those same landmarks through their own subjective filters.

The meditation we're going to be practising in this course is awareness of naturally occurring sense experiences, as well as a detailed classification and analysis of those same experiences. If this does not fit with your preconceived idea of what meditation is, then please broaden your definition of meditation. 

## The right posture for meditation
If you say the word 'meditation', what posture do you think of? The first one that comes to mind is sitting, bolt upright, preferably in full lotus posture. But this is more a remnant of the Indian cultural heritage than a direct instruction from the Buddha. 

Interestingly, in most contexts, sitting is just one of many postures mentioned for meditation. In the initial instructions of the gradual training, alternating between sitting and walking is recommended.

> *idha, mahānāma, ariyasāvako divasaṃ **caṅkamena** **nisajjāya** āvaraṇīyehi dhammehi cittaṃ parisodheti, rattiyā paṭhamaṃ yāmaṃ **caṅkamena** **nisajjāya** āvaraṇīyehi dhammehi cittaṃ parisodheti ... rattiyā pacchimaṃ yāmaṃ paccuṭṭhāya **caṅkamena** **nisajjāya** āvaraṇīyehi dhammehi cittaṃ parisodheti.* 
> 
> In this case, a disciple of the noble one purifies his mind from obstructive mental states during the day, during the first watch of the night (6pm-10pm) ... and after waking up, in the last watch of the night (2am-6am) by **sitting and walking**.
> 
> *MN53 sekhasuttaṃ*

The *satipaṭṭhāṇa* sutta specifically mentions knowing all the four postures and everything in-between. 

> *bhikkhu **gacchanto** vā gacchāmī’ti pajānāti, **ṭhito** vā ṭhitomhī’ti pajānāti, **nisinno** vā nisinnomhī’ti pajānāti, **sayāno** vā sayānomhī’ti pajānāti. yathā yathā vā panassa kāyo paṇihito hoti tathā tathā naṃ pajānāti.*  
> 
> when **moving** a monk knows, 'I am moving', when **standing** he knows, 'I am standing', when **seated** he knows, 'I am seated', when **lying down** he knows, 'I am lying down'. Whatever way the body is positioned, he knows it as such.
> 
> *MN10 mahāsatipaṭṭhānasuttaṃ, kāyānupassanā iriyāpathapabbaṃ*

Interestingly, the sitting posture is only specifically mentioned in a few meditation instructions in the early discourses, most commonly as a preparation for the practice of mindfulness with breathing. 

> *so pacchābhattaṃ piṇḍapātappaṭikkanto **nisīdati** pallaṅkaṃ ābhujitvā ujuṃ kāyaṃ paṇidhāya parimukhaṃ satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā.*  
> 
> After the meal, having returned from the alms-round, **he sits down**, folding the legs into a cross-legged posture, setting the body upright, and establishing mindfulness to the fore.
> 
> *DN2 sāmaññaphalasuttaṃ*
 
And sitting is also specifically mentioned in the simile for the fourth *jhāna*.

> *seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, puriso odātena vatthena sasīsaṃ pārupetvā **nisinno** assa, nāssa kiñci sabbāvato kāyassa odātena vatthena apphuṭaṃ assa.*  
> 
> Just as if a person was **seated**, covered from head to foot in a white cloth, there would not be any part of the entire body uncovered by the white cloth. 
> 
> *MN39 mahāassapurasuttaṃ*

So, while a sitting posture is essential for the deepest reaches of meditation, it's more helpful to think of meditation as a continuous activity performed in all postures throughout the day. 

If you think of meditation as a sitting-only activity, your attention is certain to lapse when you stand up and move around. It is enormously beneficial to keep alert to experience in all postures, and develop continuity of awareness. 

[[2.01 Coming back to your senses|Next]]

# 2.01 Coming back to your senses

## Inherent delusion
There's an inherent delusion built into language. When someone says "I see you", the language presupposes an 'I', an act of seeing by that 'I', and a separate 'you' that is the object of seeing.

The Buddha had an entirely different way of understanding this process of seeing, and all the other acts of sense perception. He also left very clear instructions on how to develop his way of perceiving, and the understanding that results from it. Over the duration of this course, hopefully we can start to dismantle the common illusion of an 'I', a subject of experience that sees objects, hears sounds, smells scents, tastes flavours, feels physical sensations and cognizes thoughts, and replace it with a more realistic model of experience. You will still say "I see you", but you will no longer be fooled that the structure of language in any way represents the structure of experience. And most importantly, you will not be fooled that the structure of language has any actual bearing on the nature of an experiencing self. 

To do this, we're going to use the framework of the Buddha's teaching on *saḷāyatana*.

## Saḷāyatana etymology
*Saḷ* is a Pāḷi word, related to Sanskrit *ṣaṣ* and a cognate of, and identical in meaning to, the English word six. 

*Āyatana* comes from the root √*yat* which means 'to stretch', in all literal and figurative senses. An *ā**yat**ana* is the act of stretching out, or something which stretches out, extends in a direction. Figuratively, it means a field, a dimension, a domain. So *saḷāyatana* literally means the six fields, the six dimensions, and in a Buddhist context refers to the six fields of sense experience.

And why six sense fields, when we commonly talk about five senses? The Buddha always included the five senses you are familiar with, and the mind as a sixth sense. More on that shortly. 

## Boring repetitions in Pāḷi texts
If you're familiar with Buddhist texts, *saḷāyatana* is one of those topics that is so frequently discussed in the suttas that one almost becomes immune to it. Hearing the words so often in theory, thinking you understand it, it's easy to gloss over it, and fail to look deeper into the topic experientially. 

The Buddha repeated the main points of this topic so frequently that in texts they are just elided with *peyyāla*:

> *sotaṃ anattā …pe… ghānaṃ anattā … jivhā anattā … kāyo anattā … mano anattā.*
> 
> the ear is impersonal ... the nose is impersonal ... the tongue is impersonal ... the mind is impersonal.

Each one of the dot-dot-dots elides an entire paragraph. The monk chanting the text is expected to correctly fill in the blanks from memory.  

It's fine to elide these repetitious passages when going through the theory of the topic, but in meditation, one needs to carefully examine every aspect in detail. So, in this course, we're not going to be skipping over any *peyyāla* when the time comes to examine what the words are pointing at within our own experience.
## The five senses
First, some basics about sense experience, which might sound so simple that they don't need to be said. But let's build up our understanding of the senses from the ground upwards, not taking anything for granted.

### 1. Specific objects
Each sense has specific objects. The eyes can only perceive visible matter. They cannot perceive invisible matter, like air, or anything which is not matter. They also cannot perceive sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations or thoughts.

Likewise, the ears can only perceive vibrations within a certain frequency range. They cannot perceive sights, smells, tastes, tactile sensations or thoughts. Similarly, for each other sense. 

An example of this being expressed in early discourses can be found where a spiritually advanced Brahman approaches the Buddha and makes this very statement about the five senses.

> *pañcimāni, bho gotama, indriyāni nānāvisayāni nānāgocarāni, na aññamaññassa gocaravisayaṃ paccanubhonti. katamāni pañca? cakkhundriyaṃ, sotindriyaṃ, ghānindriyaṃ, jivhindriyaṃ, kāyindriyaṃ. imesaṃ nu kho, bho gotama, pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ nānāvisayānaṃ nānāgocarānaṃ na aññamaññassa gocaravisayaṃ paccanubhontānaṃ kiṃ paṭisaraṇaṃ, ko ca nesaṃ gocaravisayaṃ paccanubhotī'ti?*
> 
> Sir Gotama, there are these five sense faculties with different fields and different domains, which don't experience each other's fields and domains. What five? The sense of sight, the sense of hearing, the sense of smell, the sense of taste and the sense of touch. What do these five rely upon, what experiences their field and domain?
> 
> *SN48.42 uṇṇābhabrāhmaṇasuttaṃ*

The Buddha's answer, of course, was that these five rely on the mind, the mind experiences each of their field and domain.  

### 2. In the present moment
Each of the five sense can only perceive objects in the present moment. The nose can never smell a scent from the past, nor from the future, only one that is present. So sense perception is by its very nature a present moment activity. And present moment awareness cannot be of anything except what is happening through the senses right now. So if you want to be present, simply come back to your senses.

Everybody, from a very young age, has the ability to know what they are experiencing through the senses right now. Anybody can do this. So why even discuss it? There's obviously nothing new to learn here if sense perception is something that young children can do. 

Two things. Firstly, while anyone can perceive through the senses, very few people have the ability to *sustain* present moment awareness of the senses for any length of time. Not even for a minute in most cases. The mind quickly gets bored and wanders off into its own stories. So learning to *maintain* present moment awareness is a skill that needs to be practised and developed. That's the first thing we're here to do. 

Secondly, because sense experience is so common, nobody gives it a second thought. Nobody questions the basic presumptions of sense experience. "Yes, I can see you. So what?" That's the second thing we're here to do, to really examine the structure of this everyday sense experience and see if our basic assumptions about subjective experiences are actually correct. Is there really a separate 'I' (a subject of experience), the activity of 'seeing' (a process of experiencing), and a 'you' (an object of experience). Does the structure of language match the structure of experience? These are questions we hope to examine and answer in detail. 

## The sixth sense of mind
The Buddha always included the mind as the sixth *āyatana*, a distinct domain of sense experience. The mind is clearly different from the other senses, but also has some similarities. It too is dependent on an object - it can perceive all the objects of the five senses, as well as a broad range of mental experiences.

It not only has the ability to produce mental experiences in the present, but also the ability to remember past experiences, imagine, and plan for the future too. The mind alone has the ability to experience things which are tangibly real, as well as completely imaginary objects. Even thoughts of the past, and imaginations about the future are present moment experiences. They only take place in the present, even if their content is about the past or the future.

So with that basic understanding in place, let's delve into the world of the sense. 

## Meditation on coming back to your senses 

![[1. Coming Back To Your Senses.mp3]]

%% 
This is a basic meditation instruction on coming back to your senses.  

Whatever you are doing, walking, standing, sitting or lying down, straighten out your posture, and relax. 

Take a deep breath in and out. 

And another one in and out.

And another one in and out. 

Relaxed and alert is the ideal state to be in. 

The theme of our meditation is going to be experience itself. 

What do you need to do to have an experience? Nothing, it's already happening. So turn your attention to what's already happening. 

The sights, sounds, smells, tastes, physical sensations, and all the variety of mental phenomena that are present right now within experience. 

There's no need to create any special experience, merely know what is happening right now. 

What's happening to you right now is completely personal and unpredictable. But what is certain is that it will be some sight, some sound, some smell, some taste, some physical sensation or some mental activity. These are really the only experiences that ever happen. 

Stay with experience. Follow whatever happens. Nothing special will happen, just normal everyday experiences. 

Sounds, feelings in the body, thought appearing in the mind. Normal stuff. Pay attention to the normal stuff. 

It can be quite relaxing just to pay attention to whatever is happening. There's no stress to do anything, just be relaxed, comfortable and know experiences as they come up. 

Nothing is required other than some attention, some awareness of what is happening. All the rest happens quite naturally. 

There's absolutely nothing to do. Just relax and know what's happening. That's the only job you have to right now. It's great work if you can get it!

What you're experiencing right now is the world of the senses. Six fields of sense experience, if your eyes are open -  seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling physical sensations, and a whole range of mental experiences. This is the place where we are going to be working. This is the *kammaṭṭhāna*, quite literally, the place of work. 

Whenever you get lost in thought, come back to your senses. Eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind.  

This world of the senses is the only world you've ever known. Everything that's ever happened in your life has happened right here. Everything that every will happen, will happen right here. This is where it all happens. 

You can tell others about your experiences, but nobody else has access to this. Your internal world, the immediate visceral experience of the six senses. This is your personal subjective reality. And the only reality you've ever really known.

Keep paying attention to the world of the senses. 

Keep coming back to your senses.

[[2.02 Sense of sight|Next]]

# 2.02 Sense of sight

Let's begin by examining each sense individually through introspection. First up, the sense of sight.

## Meditation on the sense of sight

![[2. Sense of Sight.mp3]]

%% 
Let's spend a little time with the first sense, the sense of sight. 

Bring your attention to the visual field, the world of seeing, all the information coming through the eye channel. 

If you're sitting down, open your eyes a little, you can defocus slightly. If you're walking or moving around, keep the eyes open and watch where you're going.

It doesn't matter so much what you're seeing, what objects you are looking at. The important thing is to know, right now the experience is of 'seeing'. There is a visual experience happening. 

Look at the entire field of visual experience. All the different objects that you see are part of the visual field. Instead of looking at the objects, see the whole field. Not the objects of vision, but vision itself.

Focus on the act of seeing, the fact of seeing, the field of sight. Right now, seeing is happening. This is a visual experience. 

---

While you're seeing, you'll still be hearing, smelling, feeling physical sensations and thinking thoughts, but give priority to this process of seeing.

Give your full attention to the sense of sight. 

---

When your mind wanders off into thought, come back to this very simple, quite boring, sense of sight, knowing that right now you are seeing. 

Seeing is almost always available to experience, but when nothing interesting is happening in the visual field, the mind will tend to wander off. This is part of the training, to condition your mind to stay where you put it. Sit, stay, good dog. 

If you are easily distracted, just mentally note to yourself, "seeing", "this is sight", "eye channel" or whatever language is useful to you. Noting or labelling can be very helpful in the beginning to anchor the mind to the task at hand. 

---

Notice the types of objects in the visual field. Shapes, colours, light and dark. That's all the eye really perceives.

---

Notice the range of the visual field. How far seeing extends to the left and to the right ... up and down. 

Notice that you can't see above, below or behind you.

---

Notice the accuracy of seeing, in focus in the centre, fuzzy everywhere else.

---

Notice how attention automatically jumps to the other senses as soon as there is a strong stimulus coming from another sense field. It's perfectly natural, nothing to change. Just know that it's happening and bring the mind back to seeing. 

---

Notice how when you blink or close your eyes, your sense of sight temporarily disappears. And when you open the eyes again, your sense of sight reappears. It seems like stating the obvious, but this is something we will explore in more detail, the conditions required for seeing. 

---

This exercise is merely to orientate you to the sense of sight. 

Later on we will move to more open awareness, and then you need to know very clearly, "this is the sense of sight", "this is the eye channel" so there will be no confusion about which sense you are experiencing.  

---

Keep coming back to this sense of sight. Give it your full attention. 

Remember to blink.

[[2.03 Sense of hearing|Next]]

 

# 2.03 Sense of hearing

## Meditation on the sense of hearing

![[3. Sense of Hearing.mp3]]

%%
Let's spend a little time with the second sense, the sense of hearing.

Bring your attention to the auditory field, the world of sounds, all the information coming through the ear channel. 

Straight away, notice how different the sense of hearing is from the sense of sight. It's a totally different experience to seeing. 

Don't pay much attention to the things that you hear, to what the sounds are, birds, people talking, cars, but zoom out a little and pay attention to the fact of hearing, the act of hearing, the whole field of hearing. 

All the individual sounds that you hear are just part of this auditory field. 

Give your full attention to the sense of hearing. 

---


If you find it useful, note to yourself, "hearing", "sounds", "ear channel", or whatever language is useful to help bring your attention to this sense field. Use noting or labelling to support your attention when it is easily distracted from the simple act of hearing. 

---

Notice the spacial dimension of hearing, how it's three-dimensional, giving the impression of being 360 degrees around, above and below. So different from seeing, which is all upfront. 

---

This is hearing. The sense of hearing. A field of sound. The ear channel. 

---

Notice what the ear actually perceives. Hearing knows nothing about "birds" or "cars" or "dogs". It only knows high and low frequencies, loud and soft volumes, different tones. The words and labels come from the mind, not from the ear. These are two entirely different sense fields. Come back to the simple world of sounds, frequencies and tones. 

---

Close your eyes if they are open, stand still if you are moving about, and give your full attention to the field of sound. 

---

Notice how attention automatically jumps to the other senses as soon as there is a strong stimulus coming from elsewhere. Just know that it's happening and bring the mind back to hearing.

---

Notice how the ears have no off button, there's no way to close the ears other than manually sticking your fingers in them. The ears are always on, day and night. The only way to stop hearing is to stop paying attention to sound. 

---

 
Paying attention to the senses like this is a kind of "base level" or "default mode" for mindfulness. Whenever you start cultivating attention, always start with these simple exercises and build up. In time, you will become very familiar with these fields of experience and be able to distinguish them very clearly from one another. 

Come back to the sense of hearing.

---

Keep coming back to this sense of hearing. Give it your full attention.

[[2.04 Sense of smell|Next]]







# 2.04 Sense of smell


## Meditation on the sense of smell

![[4. Sense of Smell.mp3]]

%%
Let's spend a little time with the third sense, the sense of smell.

For this exercise it might be helpful to get up and walk around, in nature if you can, it's full of smells. 

Bring your attention to the olfactory field, this whole world of smells, scents, odours, perfumes, all the information coming in through the nose channel. 

Some people have a very strong sense of smell and are easily overwhelmed by smells. Others have a very weak sense of smell and only notice smells when they are very near and very strong. If you have a strong sense of smell, you should have no problem bringing your attention to the smells in your environment. If you have a weak sense of smell, perhaps you can actively go and sniff scented objects.

---

If you find it useful, note to yourself, "smelling", or "smells", or "nose channel", or whatever language is useful to help bring your attention to this sense field. Use noting or labelling to support your attention, especially when it is easily distracted from the simple act of smelling. 

---

Immediately notice how different the sense of smell is from the sense of sight or hearing. 

---

Notice that there is no real directionality with the sense of smell. In order to get a bearing on the source, you need to physically turn your head. If you've ever watched a dog, which has an acute sense of smell, even they have to move their head about and stick their nose into things to locate the source of smells. 

---

Notice how different the sense of smells is when inhaling compared to exhaling. 

---

When you are around food and drink, it's a really good time to actively engage with the sense of smell. Most of what we call flavours are actually smells. There's no pineapple flavour, there's only pineapple smell and the accompanying sweet and sour flavours.

---

When you engage with people, notice how strong smelling they are. To hide the fact that they are strong smelling, people use even stronger scents to mask their natural odour.

---

Notice that smells are an entirely separate field of experience from seeing and from hearing. Smells are entirely within their own domain, and there's no crossover between smells and sights and sounds at the sense level at least. 

---

Notice the smells that you like. And the smells that you don't like. The smells that you can tolerate, even if they are strong. The smells that you can't tolerate, even if they are weak. It's helpful to see that liking and disliking occur in the mind, not in the nose. 

---

Keep coming back to this sense of smell. Give it your full attention.

[[2.05 Sense of taste|Next]]







# 2.05 Sense of taste

## Meditation on the sense of taste

![[5. Sense of Taste.mp3]]

%%

Let's spend a little time with the fourth sense, the sense of taste.

Bring your attention to the gustatory field, the world of flavours, all the information coming from the tongue.

The time to do this is while eating, or drinking, or when there is something in your mouth. 

The rest of the time, all you can really taste is the inside of your mouth and saliva, which you probably have become so accustomed to you may think there is no taste. 

It doesn't matter so much what you're tasting, sweet, sour, salty or bitter, the important thing is to know that, right now, the experience is of 'tasting', this is the tongue channel. 

---

With taste, it's very important to differentiate the experience that is coming from taste and the experience that is coming from smell. These two are distinct. 

If needs be, stop breathing for a moment, or pinch your nose closed to remove the sense of smell and focus exclusively on taste. 

Explore this world of taste, sense information coming from the tongue.

---

Focus on the act of tasting, the fact of tasting, the field of flavours, this is the tongue channel. 

---

Right now, tasting is happening. This is a tongue experience. Give your full attention to the sense of taste. 

---

If you are easily distracted, just mentally note to yourself, "tasting", "this is flavour", "tongue channel", or whatever language is useful to you to maintain awareness of taste. 

---

When your mind wanders off into thought, come back to this very simple, quite boring, sense of taste, knowing that right now you are tasting. 

---

The sense of taste is not often available to experience, only at the time of eating and drinking. So especially at those times, give your full attention to the tongue. 

---

Notice the initial flavour of a mouthful, how the taste changes over time, how quickly the flavour disappears, how, after a short time, even the most tasty food becomes utterly flavourless. 

---

Notice your response to tastes, things that you like the flavour of, things that you don't like, things that you're indifferent to. There's often not such a big difference in taste, but an enormous difference in perception and response to taste. 

---

Throughout the day, anytime anything goes into your mouth, focus on the flavour. 

This is the sense of taste. 

---

Keep coming back to this sense of taste. Give it your full attention.

## Meditation on the sense of touch

![[6. Sense of Touch.mp3]]

%%
Let's spend a little time with the fifth sense, the sense of touch. 

Bring your attention to the tactile field, this world of tangible sensations coming from nerve ending throughout your body, all the information coming through the body channel.  

If you're sitting down, you can close your eyes. This will help to bring the bodily sensations into focus.

It doesn't matter so much what you're feeling, the important thing is to know, right now the experience is of 'feeling', 'sensations', 'body channel'. There is a somatic experience happening.

---

All the different sensations that you feel in your body are part of the field of touch.

Focus on the act of feeling, the fact of feeling sensations, this whole field of tactile experience. 

---

Right now, physical sensations are happening. Give your full attention to the sense of touch. 

---

It doesn't matter if the sensations are strong or subtle, pleasant or unpleasant, quickly disappearing or long-lasting, just keep being aware of them as sensations. This is a bodily experience.  

---

When your mind wanders off into thought, come back to this ever present field of physical sensations.  

---

Notice how active this domain of physical sensations is, compared to smell or taste, how filled with continuous sensations the body is, there is always something happening somewhere in the body. 

This is probably the most reliable meditation object, for beginners and advanced yogis alike, as there is always physical sensation to be felt. Perhaps this is the reason that the very first foundation of mindfulness is *kāyānupassanā*, following the experience of having a body. It is always available to be experienced. 

---

Feeling the body is always available to awareness. If you're alive, you're breathing, which creates sensations. Gravity is always pushing the body towards the earth, creating sensations wherever the body is making contact with a surface beneath it. These two things are always directly tangible through the sense of touch.

---

There is always sensation to be experienced when the body comes into contact with any physical object, including itself. You just need to tune in to sensation, and it's always there.

---

If you are easily distracted, just mentally note to yourself, "feeling", "this is physical sensation", "touch", "body channel", or whatever language is useful to you. Noting or labelling can be very helpful in the beginning to anchor the mind to the current task.

---

Notice the types of objects in the field of touch - vibrating, throbbing, tingling, tickling, flowing, fluttering, itching, numbness, pinching, pulling, pushing, pricking, pulsating, rippling, radiating, aching, paining, stabbing, stinging, soothing ... so many types of sensation, all just physical sensations, part of the field of touch, experience-able through the body channel. 

---

Notice the sensations at all the points of contact, where one part of the body is touching another, or the body is touching some other physical object, your clothes, cushion, or the ground.

---

If you're sitting, notice where your hands or arms are touching the legs, where the butt is touching the cushion beneath it, where the legs are touching each other, where the feet are touching the ground. If you're walking, notice the sensation where your feet touch on the earth.

---

Be very still for a moment. Stop moving entirely. Notice all the sensations that the body generates itself, without any movement. 

---

Notice the range of the sense of touch. It is quite strictly limited to the body.

---

Notice how sensation are prominent in certain areas of the body, the face, eyes, cheeks, lips, and scalp, the hands, the chest, the stomach area, the buttocks, the legs. 

---

Notice how sensations are difficult to discern or even absent in other parts of the body.

---

Notice how physical sensations come out of nowhere, occupy your attention, change, and disappear, replaced by the next sensation which grabs your attention.  

---

There is a lot of change happening within physical sensation, this is very obvious from the beginning, and only increases with attention. You have very little control over these small, relentless changes in the body, which manifest as some sensation or another.  

---

Keep coming back to this sense of touch, what it feels like to have a body, this entire field of body awareness. 


---

Give these sensations your full attention. This is what's called keeping the body in mind.

# 2.07 Sense of mind


"Where is my mind?" you may ask.

We live in a world of mental experience every waking moment 24/7/365. All the senses converge on the mind, are processed by the mind, perceived by the mind, responded to by the mind, and are known by the mind. Without the mind, there is quite literally no experience whatsoever.

For anyone starting with meditation on *saḷāyatana*, the mind as a sense is the most difficult thing to grasp in the beginning, difficult to perceive distinctly from the other senses. It's like we humans spend our entire life immersed in a gaseous atmosphere, without which we'd die in an instant, and yet we can say, "What air? I don't see any air. " In the same way, someone may say, "What mind? I don't see any mind. I only see trees and people and cars." But later it becomes obvious that you've only ever seen trees and people and cars in your mind. 

As one progresses with introspection, mind become the easiest sense to perceive, not only because it is ubiquitous, but because it is so fast and relentless in its activity. It is so busy gathering information from the other five sense, collating them, interpreting them, and forming responses to them, that it becomes very easy to see and follow. There is not a single moment when mental phenomena are not available to experience, except perhaps in the deepest states of sleep and coma. 

The Buddha himself remarked that his basic awareness consists of mental objects, namely feeling tone, perceptions and thoughts. 

> *tasmātiha tvaṃ, ānanda, idampi tathāgatassa acchariyaṃ abbhutadhammaṃ dhārehi. idhānanda, tathāgatassa viditā vedanā uppajjanti, viditā upaṭṭhahanti, viditā abbhatthaṃ gacchanti, viditā saññā uppajjanti, viditā upaṭṭhahanti, viditā abbhatthaṃ gacchanti, viditā vitakkā uppajjanti, viditā upaṭṭhahanti, viditā abbhatthaṃ gacchanti.*  
> 
> Therefore Ananda, you should remember this too as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Tathāgata. For him, the feeling tone of experiences are seen as they arise, persist and disappear, perceptions are seen as they arise persist and disappear, thoughts are seen as they arise persist and disappear.

## Meditation on the sense of mind

![[7. Sense of Mind.mp3]]

%%
Let's spend a little time with the sixth sense, the sense of mind. 

Bring your attention to the mind, become aware of this field of mental experiences.

Some constructed mental activities might help you to distinctly perceive mental experience. 

Silently, say the word "mind" to yourself. The appearance of a word in the mind. That's a mental experience. 

Silently, spell the word "mind". "m-i-n-d". That's a mental experience. 

Take the letters of the word mind, and sort them alphabetically. That's a mental experience. 

What's the very thing that you think of when I say the word "mind". That's a mental experience.

What's the first thing you remember from when you were young? 

What was the last meal that you ate?

All memories are mental experiences. 

Think about what you're going to do this evening? What are you going to do tomorrow? Thinking about the future is a mental experience. 

Imagine being 100 meters up in the air, looking down on yourself. Imagination is a mental experience. 

What is the thing that you are most concerned about right now? Worry is a mental experience. Anxiety is a mental experience. 

What is seven times eight? Calculation is a mental experience. Logic is a mental experience. Reasoning is a mental experience.

Think of one thing you can do to really improve the quality of your life. Ideas are a mental experience.  

What is your mood right now? That's a mental experience.

What it is like to be really sad, and depressed. That's a mental experience. 

What it is like to be really happy, elated, full of joy? That's a mental experience. 

When you fall asleep, your mind often gets flooded with hypnagogic images. That's a mental experience. 

All dreams are mental experience. 

Struggling to remember them in the morning. That's a mental experience. 

Think of somebody that irritates you. Send them some good wishes. That's a mental experience. 

Think of somebody that you like. Send them some good vibes. That's another mental experience. 

Think of some random person you recently met. Also send them some good wishes. That's a mental experience. 

What is your inner dialogue saying, the voice in your head? That's a mental experience. 

What are your plans for the future? That's a mental experience. 

Think of a beautiful sunset. Imagining seeing is a mental experience. 

Think of the sound of birds chirping in the morning. Thinking about sounds is a mental experience.

Think of the smell of fish. Recollecting smells is a mental experience. 

Think of tasting pineapple. That acidity is a mental experience. 

Think of having an icy cold shower. That's also a mental experience. 

When you see something and think, "How beautiful". That's a mental experience. 

When you see something and think, "Ugh, how ugly". That's a mental experience. 

When you see something and think, "Yawn, how boring". That's a mental experience. 

Would you like some tea, coffee, fruit juice or water to drink right now? Choice is a mental experience.

What's your favourite colour? Preference is a mental experience.

What do you think about the current political situation? What are your views on abortion? What do you think happens after death? All opinions, views and beliefs are mental experiences.

Your attention moving from one sense to another. That's a mental experience.

The pleasantness or unpleasantness that arises in response to every single sense experience. That's a mental experience.

Being able to name any object that you perceive. That's a mental experience.

Your response to every object within experience. That's a mental experience.

The fact of knowing that you're having an experience right now, awareness itself. That's a mental experience.

These are just some examples to give you an idea of the range of mental experiences. It's in no way exhaustive, in fact it's almost impossible to exhaust the range of mental experiences. But there should be enough for you to recognise mental experiences as they occur within the mental field. 

Pay attention to your mental experiences. 

Understand these are all just the mental field. 

---

Notice how the mind changes relentlessly, nothing stays still even for one second. 

Attention moves between all the senses, perceptions and thoughts arise, responses are formed, knowing is always present and shifting. 

---

Right now, the important thing is not to analyse every little phenomena that occurs in the mind, but simple to understand that this is mental activity, these are mental phenomena, these are mental processes, these are all occurring within the mental domain.

---

The important skill to develop is simply to understand when an experience is within the field of mind, to be able to clearly distinguish five sense experiences, from mental ones.

[[2.08 Open Awareness|Next]]




























 

# 2.08 Open Awareness

And finally we come to all the senses working together in a natural way. 

It's sometimes called *open* awareness, but this is a slight misnomer. In a way, it's actually more like a *closed* awareness because you only ever experience these six domains of sense experience, which are a closed system. There is nothing experience-able outside that system. But within these very hard boundaries, anything can happen, so it's open in that way. 

One analogy is of a closed-circuit TV system. There are six channels, the eye channel, ear channel, nose channel, tongue channel, body channel and mind channel. But on each of those six channels, there is a vast range of possible experiences.

It's sometimes also called *choice-less* awareness, another misnomer because attention is making choices about what to attend to every single moment. Not being aware of your choices doesn't mean that they are not happening. Nevertheless, understanding the limits of language, we shall continue with these names. 

The basic idea is very simple: you don't choose what to experience, you let attention choose experience for you. Attention naturally moves from sense to sense, from channel to channel, often faster than you can keep up with it, but it has kept you alive for this long, so it's clearly doing its job well. 

1. As you see the words on this page, just know, "this is seeing", or "this is the eye channel".

2. As sounds make contact, just know, "this is hearing", or "this is the ear channel". 

3. As some smell becomes apparent, just know, "this is smelling", or "this is the nose channel".

4. As you taste food and drink, just know, "this is tasting", or "this is the tongue channel". 

5. As bodily experiences come to your attention, just know, "this is physical sensation", or "this is the body channel".

6. As thoughts become prominent, just know, "this is mental experience", "or this is the mind channel".

For the purpose of progress in this meditation on *saḷāyatana*, it is recommended to note the field of experience, rather than the objects of experience, "eye channel" rather than "tree", "bird", or "monkey". The purpose is to condition yourself to clearly differentiate between the different fields of experience., and slowly recondition the mind to perceive in a new way. 

Let your attention move naturally between these six fields of sense experience, as they have been doing as long as you've been alive. All that's being added is *continuous knowing* of what is already happening.

Follow each experience from the moment it arises, observe the changes until the moment when something new comes up, and the previous experience disappears. There's nothing to do except follow experience as it move from one sense to the next, one sense to the next. Try and keep up, experience moves fast!

The Pāḷi word for this is *anpassanā*. The prefix *anu-* adds the meaning of 'following', or 'being right behind'. The root *√dis / pass* means 'to see'. The *-anā* suffix creates feminine abstract process nouns. So the word *anpassanā* literally means "the process of follow-seeing".  *Dhammānupassanā*, of which the six sense fields are a part, literally means "the process of follow-seeing experiential phenomena".

With practice, it is possible to turn this from a simple exercise, into a strength, into a power, into a superpower, into a *bojjhaṅga*, an element of awakening. This simple exercise is aimed at nothing less than cultivating the *satisambojjhaṅga*, mindfulness as an element of awakening. 

## What this is not
Let's be very clear about what you're *not* trying to do here. 

You're not trying to control experience.

You're not trying to exclude some experience.

You're not trying to have some special experience.

You're not trying to stop thinking and have a perfectly peaceful mind.

You're not trying to experience bliss or rapture.

You are not trying to achieve some altered state of mind that you've heard about or read about.

Many of the above are side effects of meditation, some might say *unwanted* side effects of meditation, not the goal of meditation. 

For now, you're just trying to know what's happening, that's all. It's an excellent exercise to see what the mind is really doing most of the time. 

## Meditation on open awareness

![[8. Open Awareness.mp3]]

%%

First, as a warm-up exercise, let's spend a few minutes going through each sense field, so that you can clearly differentiate each field of experience from the others.

Open your eyes. See whatever you are seeing. Just know this is seeing, this is the visual field, this experience is coming through the eye channel.

Your ears are always open. Hear whatever you are hearing. Just know this is hearing, this is the auditory field, this experience is coming through the ear channel. 

Take a deep inhalation. Smell whatever you are smelling. Just know this is smelling, this is the olfactory field, this experience is coming through the nose channel. 

Taste whatever is in your mouth right now, if nothing is in your mouth it will just be the slightly salty, sometimes bitter taste of the inside of your mouth. Just know this is tasting, this is the gustatory field, this experience is coming through the tongue channel. 

Feel whatever sensations you can feel in the body. Just know this is physical sensation, this is a bodily experience, this experience is coming through the body channel. 

Turn your attention towards your mind and know whatever mental phenomena are occurring. How are you feeling today? Just understand, this is a mental experience, this is the mental field, this experience is coming through the mind channel.

It's helpful in the beginning to spend a few minutes clearly differentiating the six fields of experience. 

Now that you've done the warm-up, it's time for the real exercise, which is open awareness, knowing whatever is happening as it is happening.

The best thing about this practice is you don't need to do much, you simply need to pay attention to what is already going on.

Instead of choosing which sense field to pay attention to, know whatever is occurring naturally. Attention normally moves between the senses, from seeing to a sound, to a sensation in the body, to another sensation in the body, to a thought, to another thought, to a memory, and so on. Your job is just to know whatever experience is present right now.

---

Calmly follow whatever is happening as attention moves from this to that sense field.  

Your job is to follow closely behind and know whatever is happening.

There's always some naturally occurring experience. Give your full attention to that. 

---

If you're walking, the primary experiences are going to be seeing, hearing, smelling, body sensations and thinking. 

If you are sitting with eyes closed, your primary experiences are going to be hearing, body sensations and mental activity.

---

Keep your attention on naturally occurring experience. 

Keep following experience from one sense to the next. 

---

The biggest thing that will pull you away from the experience at hand is thinking, and not knowing that you are thinking. It is natural to start thinking, there is nothing wrong with thinking, the mind forms thoughts all the time. But your job is to know what is happening, so when thinking, you must *know* that you are thinking. The *usual* case is you are completely involved in the story of a thought, it is *unusual* to know that this is thought. So when thinking, catch yourself, know, "ah! This is thinking" and come back to sense experience. 

---

Notice how when you start thinking, all the other sense fade into the background and the thought story takes the spotlight, front and centre in the mind. Your full attention is on thinking, not know that you are thinking. At the time, your eyes are open, but you are not seeing. The world is full of sounds, but you are not hearing. The body is full of sensations, but there may as well not be body. Know that thinking is just a mental experience, it happens on the mind channel. And come back to following naturally occurring experience. 

---

Keep knowing whatever is happening. 

Keep following experience as it happens. 

---

Don't expect perfectly continuous awareness. This is a skill to be developed slowly over time. Do the best you can. It's so helpful to know that you're no longer paying attention, only then can you bring your attention back to the senses. 

Don't try to force any kind of experience to happen. Just know what's naturally occurring. The only thing that you're adding is awareness. Other than that, let things unfold as they do. 

Don't get frustrated if it seems difficult in the beginning and you keep losing awareness. That is also a normal part of the process. 

Keep knowing whatever is happening. 

Keep following experience.

---

The most vital skill in the beginning to catch the mind when it wanders off. Just to know that it has wandered off, that is now folly engrossed in a mental story, oblivious to all other experiences. This is the most useful gift that you can possibly give yourself. It will really help you to come out of the deeply ingrained habit of getting totally absorbed in your own stories, and not even knowing that it's a story. Come back to the experience at hand, come back to your senses.

---

Keep following whatever experience is happening. It happens, and you're right behind it with awareness. 

---

Following whatever experience is happening, watching it appear, morph and be replaced by the next experience. Attention naturally moving to another sense, a new experience arises, changes and disappears. Your job is just to keep following this naturally occurring process. 

---

This is how to train attention, how to make attention powerful, discriminative, tuned into the most subtle changes and, most importantly, continuous.

[[2.09 Name the Channel|Next]]












# 2.09 Name the Channel

Open awareness is a very useful, versatile, foundational skill in mental training. Using it as a base, there are numerous exercises that can be practised to develop analytical skills and insight. The first step along that path is being able to clearly discern what field of experience is happening, or as we shall call it, "naming the channel".

Naming the channel is one of the easiest way to build up speed and accuracy of analysing what kind of experience is happening. And it is reasonably easy to do. 

When seeing, just note, "eye channel" or "eye".

When hearing, just note, "ear channel" or "ear".

When smelling, just note, "nose channel" or "nose".

When tasting, just note, "tongue channel" or "tongue".

When feeling physical sensation, just note, "body channel" or "body".

When a mental experience is occurring, just note, "mind channel" or "mind".

Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. That's all. 

This ability to quickly and accurately name the channel of experience will be very useful in the meditations which follow later in the course, related to understanding dependency and developing insight.

Naming the channel has the added benefit of helping you to stay with actual experience and not run off into habitual thoughts, daydreams and fantasies. In the beginning, noting is useful as an anchor to present moment experience. 

It also helps with reconditioning the mind to perceive in a new way. The normal mode of human perception is entirely focused on the *objects* of awareness, and what goals can be achieved with those objects. How is this person or thing useful, how can it be of benefit to you, or endanger you. Naming the channel re-frames perception to start noticing the *structure* of awareness. 

Something that becomes very apparent with practice is that there is no cross-over between the five senses. The information coming from the eye channel is a totally different type of information from what is coming through the ear channel. Hearing in no way blends with smelling. Tastes and bodily experience are entirely separate domains. But all five senses are available to the mind. 

In the beginning, this exercise may be a little bit chaotic. You're not used to interpreting experience in this way. Your usual mode is more object-orientated and goal-orientated. So if the channel of experience is not immediately clear, don't get stuck there, just move onto the next experience. 

In summary, for this exercise

1. know what's happening with open awareness
2. name the channel that experience is happening on
## Meditation on naming the channel

![[9. Name the Channel.mp3]]

%%
This is an awareness exercise, naming the channel of experience. 

Firstly, establish open awareness. 

Calmly, know whatever is happening right now.

Be receptive to whatever comes up, you're not choosing to have this or that experience. Just notice whatever is prominent right now, and give your full attention to that. 

Experiences come up, change and disappear to be replaced by the next one. Allow your attention to move fluidly from one experience to the next.

---

Every single experience is happening within its own field. Just for a moment, note which field it belongs to. Name the channel.

Note all sights as "eye channel" or "eye" for short.

Note all sounds as "ear channel" or "ear" for short.

Note all smells as "nose channel" or "nose" for short.

Note all tastes as "tongue channel" or "tongue" for short.

Note all physical sensations as "body channel" or "body" for short.

Note all mental experiences as "mind channel" or "mind" for short.

Know each experience and note the channel of experience.

---

Know what is happening and name the channel it is happening on.

---

While seeing a sight, know that this is seeing, the sense of sight, this experience is happening on the eye channel. Pay attention to *all* the information coming in on the eye channel.

While hearing a sound, know that this is the sense of hearing, this experience is on the ear channel. Pay attention to *all* the information coming in on the ear channel.

When smelling a scent, know that this is the sense of smell, this experience is on the nose channel. Pay attention to *all* the information coming in on the nose channel.

When tasting a flavour, know that this is the sense of taste, this experience is on the tongue channel. Pay attention to *all* the information coming in on the tongue channel.

While feeling a physical sensation, know this is the sense of touch, this experience is on the body channel. Pay attention to *all* the information coming in on the body channel.

While thinking a thought, or having any other mental experience, know this is the sense of mind, this experience is happening on the mind channel. Pay attention to *all* the information coming in on the mind channel.

Clearly know each experience, briefly name the field, and come back to the experience at hand.

---

If naming the channel gets tiring or difficult, come back to simple open awareness for a minute, calmly knowing what is happening as it is happening. 

You may also find the opposite, that naming the channel gives a very powerful boost to the clarity of mindfulness. If that's the case please continue with it.

---
Know each experience and name the channel of each experience.

---

Know each experience as it occurs, and mentally note the name of the sense field.

---

If you are only able to note the channel every ten seconds, then note it every ten seconds.

If you are able to note the channel once a second, then note it once a second. 

If you are able to note the channel ten times a second, then note it ten times a second.

---

Keep following experiences as they occur. 

Keep noting the channel of the experience.

[[2.10 Dual Experiences|Next]]


# 2.10 Dual Experiences

All experiences have a dual aspect, the experience coming from the sense itself and the mental interpretation and response. In the beginning, this is difficult to differentiate, but becomes easier with practice.

Don't underestimate just how radically your ability to perceive can improve with practice, not just a small increase, but an exponential increase in the ability to differentiate ever more subtle phenomena and clearly analyse those experiences.

## Pain
Let's take a very common example that occurs for most meditators while sitting: pain in the legs. It's common to say, "My leg hurts." But let's go deeper into that experience. 

The information coming from the body is physical in nature - pressure, tightness, heat, tingling, numbness. It is also located in a specific area of the body, one can delimit a shape in which the sensation exists - a strip or patch or a circle. It also changes over time - pulsing, throbbing, expanding, contacting. That's the physical aspect. 

The unpleasantness of that physical sensation is experienced in the mind. The resistance to that physical sensation is experienced in the mind. The desire to move is experienced in the mind. Whatever stories you create around the pain are experienced in the mind. That's the mental aspect of the experience. With repeated practice, the dual aspects of pain become very clear.

## Emotion
It might be surprising to learn that there is not a single word in the vast collection of Buddha's discourses that corresponds directly to the English word 'emotion'. Sometimes the word *vedanā* is rendered as 'emotion', but it is an awful mistranslation. *Vedanā* describes an entirely different concept which we shall look at soon, but suffice to say it's a much simpler thing than the complexity of love or anger.

If we dissect something like anger according to *saḷāyatana*, it becomes obvious that there are two aspects to it: one is the mental experience of angry churning thoughts, a story in the mind of why you are right to be angry, and all the things you are going to tell say in anger. The other aspect is the physical experience of heat, heart racing, tension and arousal in the body. 

Almost always, what we call an emotion in English is a mental experience which also has a physical counterpart. Think of someone you love, notice the pleasant feeling in the mind and the physical sensations in the chest. Once again, two different types of experience, one mental and the other physical, both happening simultaneously.

Emotions tend to create benign or vicious circles, where the mental aspect creates a physical response, and the physical aspect creates a mental response. Next time you have any emotional reaction, please pay attention to both sides of the equation. 

## Reading
The mental / physical duality applies to all five sense experiences. Take a simple example of reading these words. What is coming from the eye is just a mass of raw visual information, there are no words, just colours, shapes, light and dark. Only when processed by the mind do these words 'make sense'. 

As you are reading, pause for a moment to really look at this text. See what is coming in on the visual channel. It may help to blur your eyes slightly, or look at the text through your peripheral vision. 

Now, look normally again. As you read, say these word slowly and loudly in your mind. Silently, pronounce all these words in a French accent. Very clearly, this is a mental experience.

Take a few moments to flip back and forth between seeing words with the eye and understanding words in the mind to make a clear differentiation between the two. 

## Naming
Even the simplest act of naming an experience reveals the physical / mental dichotomy. Stop for a moment and listen to all the sounds in your environment. Pick one to analyse. 

1. Do you like the sound? 

2. What is that sound? 

3. Is there something you want to do about the sound? 

4. Are you still aware of the sound?

Your answer to all four of these questions was a mental experience. 

In Buddhist terms, the pleasantness or unpleasantness of the sound is called *vedanā*, recognising the sound and being able to name it is called *saññā*, your volitional response to the sound is called *saṅkhāra*, and the knowing itself is *viññāṇa*.

## Eating
Another everyday experience that can be broken apart into different sense fields is eating. This is truly a multi-sense affair. 

Seeing the food in front of you is eye channel. 

Deciding what you are going to eat next is mind channel. 

Physically moving the food from your bowl to your mouth is body channel. 

As the food gets close to your lips, the smell becomes apparent, that's nose channel. 

Placing the food inside the mouth, chewing it with the teeth, moving it around with the tongue, mixing it with saliva are all body channel. 

The sound of the teeth chewing, and food and saliva moving around in your mouth is ear channel.  

The flavour is tongue channel. 

The smell coming from the chewed food inside your mouth is nose channel. 

The enjoyment is mind channel. 

And so on with the next mouthful. 

One area to make a clear distinction is between smells and flavours. For example, pineapple does not actually taste like pineapple, it *smells* like pineapple and *tastes* sweet and sour. 

To isolate the sense of taste from the sense of smell, you can stop breathing for a moment, or pinch your nose closed. How food tastes when your nose is blocked is the actual taste. Nobody enjoys food when they have a cold because the nose is blocked and there is no smell, but it is common to hear, "The food has no taste!"

## Meditation on dual experiences
As you continue your meditation, pay special attention to the dual aspect of every experience. 

When engaged in multisensory activities, try and pick apart the various channels of experience. 

[[2.11 Training Awareness|Next]]




# 2.11 Training Awareness

So far, we have covered a few different mediation exercises. 

1. The individual meditations on each sense are helpful to clearly delimit the boundaries of each type of sense experience. 

2. The meditation on open awareness is helpful to orientate you towards a skilful way of interacting with the world, with full attention to what is happening.

3. Naming the channel is helpful to improve differentiation between fast occurring, seemingly unified sense experiences. 

4. Focusing on dual and multi-sense experiences is helpful to further differentiate types of experience.   

These guided meditations are a useful starter kit to point you in the right direction, namely, being to maintain mindfulness throughout the day with a clear understanding of sense experience.

## Anytime anywhere
Paying attention to the senses is something that can be done anytime, anywhere. You don't need any special posture, equipment, outfits, gadgets, or team members to do it. There are so many times in normal daily life when you're not actively engaging in something that requires all your mental capacity. Use your many moments of free time to come back to these simple exercise of knowing the six fields of experience. Not only can it be relaxing, it is a mentally healthier alternative to mind-wandering.   

There are so many times during the day that are open for this practice. There's no excuse of "I don't have time to meditate".

- Waking up in bed, you can feel your body, you can examine your mind, you can pay attention to the world of sounds. 
- Going to the bathroom is a meditation exercise with the Buddha's own stamp of approval on it. 
- Eating your breakfast is a feast of sense experience
- Walking down the street is a great exercise in multisensory meditation.  

What you'll be replacing is idle thought, daydreaming, mind-wavering, useless speculation, worrying and fretting, memories of the past, imagination about the future, all the things that normally fill your spare moments. You can replace them with simple sense experience and immediately and very tangibly reduce your mental noise, increase your peace of mind and cultivate a much richer inner experience.

If you get nothing else from this course, please develop this one skill of coming back to the senses. It is so enormously useful, not only in daily life, but as a foundation for all deeper states of meditation.

## Turning Attention into a Superpower
Focusing the mind sounds simple, right? Even kids can do it for a moment. The hard part is *maintaining* awareness, which you'll only discover when you first engage in trying to do it. 

Anyone who begins a meditation practice discovers for themselves that the mind is much more chaotic and unruly than they could have previously imagined. Meditation doesn't make the mind like that, it just helps you to see how scattered it is naturally, something you previously never noticed before.

With time, with practise, with repetition, the mind can be conditioned to stay with experience, for minutes, then for longer periods. The more you exercise this ability, the stronger it grows. Ultimately, the mind can be trained to stay with experience continuously whenever required. This small act of adverting attention can be turned into a superpower.

What most people don't realise is that this isn't about achieving some mystical state, although those can happen. It's about getting to know your own internal world, which many people are really strangers to. 

This is a very reliable outcome of awareness training that many meditators progress to. Through these basic exercises, it is possible to become aware of much more detail, with much more clarity than you are experiencing right now. One's inner world becomes an ever richer one. 

More importantly, it is possible to have mental balance and equanimity in the face of life's ups and downs. This level of composure is impossible to even imagine for someone on the roller-coaster of reaction and over-reaction to their own sense experience.
## Training the body vs training the mind
Physical training is slow and predictable. If you're getting in shape, you might improve your speed or strength by a small percentage in a month. Maybe you'll run 10% faster or lift a bit more weight. That's just how body training works.

But the mind is an entirely different story. While your body inches forward, your mind can leap forward dramatically. In just a few weeks of consistent practice, you could potentially double or even triple your mental capabilities. And these mental gains stick around much longer than physical improvements.

This is why meditators always talk about practice. Reading about mindfulness is like looking at a map, it orientates you in the right direction. But actually practising is like walking the road. The experience transforms you in ways you can't even imagine.

Here's the crucial thing: without practice, nothing changes. You can read a thousand books about meditation, but that's like reading cookbooks without ever cooking. Theory is nice, but practical application is everything. The real insights happen when you actually undertake the process of mental training.

What most people don't realise is that what is called "mindfulness" in the modern world is really just the tip of the iceberg. It's merely the starting point for the deep mental training that's been preserved in the Buddhist monastic community for millennia.

Following this course onwards, you will see for yourself that mindfulness is just a necessary prerequisite for much more profound experiences that are possible though directing attention to the simple understanding of what is happening right now. 

[[3.01 Dependent Experiences|Next]]


# 3.01 Dependent Experiences

> All you touch and all you see
> Is all your life will ever be
> 
> *Pink Floyd "Breath"*

Starting from a firm foundation of mindfulness of sense experience, next we are going to examine the dependent nature of sense experience. 

There's an excellent sutta on the topic, Majjhima Nikāya 148 is called the Chachakkasuttaṃ, which means the Discourse on the Six Groups of Six.

This one paragraph in that sutta briefly outlines the remainder of this course. I translate very literally, and we then we can unpack the implications afterwards. 
 
> *cha ajjhattikāni āyatanāni veditabbāni, cha bāhirāni āyatanāni veditabbāni, cha viññāṇakāyā veditabbā, cha phassakāyā veditabbā, cha vedanākāyā veditabbā, cha taṇhākāyā veditabbā.*  
> 
> The six internal fields should be known, the six external fields should be known, the six classes of consciousness should be known, the six classes of contact should be known and the six classes of craving should be known. 
> 
> *MN148 chachakkasuttaṃ*

The sutta then goes on to define each group of six. 

> *cakkhāyatanaṃ, sotāyatanaṃ, ghānāyatanaṃ, jivhāyatanaṃ, kāyāyatanaṃ, manāyatanaṃ. cha ajjhattikāni āyatanāni veditabbānī’ti – iti yaṃ taṃ vuttaṃ, idametaṃ paṭicca vuttaṃ. idaṃ paṭhamaṃ chakkaṃ.*
> 
> The field of the eye, the field of the ear, the field of the nose, the field of the body, the field of the mind. It was with reference to this that it was said, "The six internal fields should be known". This is the first group of six. 

> *rūpāyatanaṃ, saddāyatanaṃ, gandhāyatanaṃ, rasāyatanaṃ, phoṭṭhabbāyatanaṃ, dhammāyatanaṃ. cha bāhirāni āyatanāni veditabbānī’ti – iti yaṃ taṃ vuttaṃ, idametaṃ paṭicca vuttaṃ. idaṃ dutiyaṃ chakkaṃ.*
> 
> The field of forms, the field of sounds, the field of smells, the field of tastes, the field of tangible sensations, the field of mental phenomena. It was with reference to this that it was said, "The six external fields should be known". This is the second group of six. 

> cakkhuñca paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṃ, sotañca paṭicca sadde ca uppajjati sotaviññāṇaṃ, ghānañca paṭicca gandhe ca uppajjati ghānaviññāṇaṃ, jivhañca paṭicca rase ca uppajjati jivhāviññāṇaṃ, kāyañca paṭicca phoṭṭhabbe ca uppajjati kāyaviññāṇaṃ, manañca paṭicca dhamme ca uppajjati manoviññāṇaṃ. cha viññāṇakāyā veditabbā’ti – iti yaṃ taṃ vuttaṃ, idametaṃ paṭicca vuttaṃ. idaṃ tatiyaṃ chakkaṃ.*
> 
> Dependent on the eye and forms, eye consciousness arises. Depending on the ear and sounds, ear consciousness arises. Dependent on the nose and smells, nose consciousness arises. Dependent on the tongue and tastes, tongue consciousness arises. Dependent on the body and tangible sensations, body consciousness arises. Dependent on the mind and mental phenomena, mind consciousness arises. It was with reference to this that it was said, "The six classes of consciousness should be known". This is the third group of six. 

So what we have here, in the terse language of Pāḷi discourses. is a discussion about the dependency of every experience. Let's explore this in more detail. 

[[3.02 The Internal Dependency|Next]]







 








 




 


 
  

# 3.02 The Internal Dependency

The first dependency is on the *ajjhattikaṃ āyatanaṃ*, literally the "internal field", which we might render more understandably into English as the "sense organ" or "internal sense base". These are the body's five sense organs and the mind.

The Buddha felt it very important to understand that every experience is dependent, it doesn't stand alone without supporting conditions. The most obvious condition for any sense experience is the organ through which the experience occurs. Without an eye, there is no sight. Without a tongue, there is no such thing as taste. 

In order to really bring this home, let's do a practical exercise of seeing the dependency of every experience. The starting point, as always, will be awareness of the six sense fields, and from there we can look at the first dependency. 

The practice consists of normal sense experience plus a little bit of analysis. Some people find the analysis invigorating, some people find it tiring. If you find that the analysis is difficult or tiring, come back to simply experiencing the senses. But after a minute, push yourself to go back to analysis, and stay with it for as long as you are able. If you are able to keep analysing every experience, by all means keep going. 

Many people practising this report even stronger mindfulness than usual, because the analysis helps you to stay with the present object, and the mind has less opportunity to run away.

Most importantly, you are creating the conditions to perceive experience in a new way. 

Stay with this exercise for a few sessions. Change posture a few times, go for a walk, take something to eat or drink, maintain your awareness of experience and keep analysing the internal dependency.

[[3.03 The External Dependency|Next]]



# 3.03 The External Dependency


## The external dependency

The second dependency is on the *bahiddhā āyatanaṃ*, literally the "external field", the objects of experience. These are the forms that the eye can see, the sounds that the ear can hear, the chemical scents that the nose can smell, the flavours that the tongue can taste, the tangible sensations that the body can feel and the entire range of mental phenomena that the mind can perceive.

It's very interesting how the Buddha classified thoughts, as 'outside' just like visible forms and sounds. This might seem strange to you if you come from a Western cultural background, but from the point of view of introspection, it makes perfect sense. 

Here we are dealing with the second way that every experience is dependent. Without an object of experience, subjectively, nothing happens.

Once again, in order to really bring this home, let's do a practical exercise of seeing the external dependency of every experience. We will begin with awareness of the six sense fields, and from there we can look at the second external dependency of each experience. 

As with the previous practice, this one consists of normal sense experience plus a little bit of analysis. If you find the analysis tiring, please come back to basic awareness of the six channels of experience. If you find the analysis empowering, then by all means, continue with it. 

All you are doing is creating a condition in the mind to perceive experience in a slightly different way. 

Stay with this exercise for a few sessions at least. Change posture a few times, go for a walk, take something to eat or drink, maintain your awareness of experience and keep analysing the external dependency.

[[3.04 Conditions for Consciousness|Next]]


# 3.04 Conditions for Consciousness

The third dependency is summarised in brief as: 

> *cakkhuñca paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṃ*
> 
> Dependent on the eye and forms, eye consciousness arises. 

And likewise for all the other senses. 

Before going further, let's delve a little deeper into the word *viññāṇa*, which is normally translated as  'consciousness', and how it is used in Buddhist texts. Etymologically it is composed of the prefix *vi-* which implies separation or distinctness, the root *√ñā* simply means 'to know', and the suffix is *-ana* is used to form neuter process nouns. So a very literal translation of *viññāṇa* would be 'the act of knowing distinctly'. 

One important thing to understand about the Buddha's use of the word *viññāṇa* is that he frequently stresses its dependent nature, the fact that it can never exist without supporting conditions. Nowhere in the whole mass of early texts can you find a reference to consciousness without an object, such as the common Indian ideas of a 'universal consciousness' or 'primordial consciousness' which is taken as a ground of being. The Buddha strongly rejected this idea. In Buddhism, consciousness always refers to 'consciousness of', awareness of a certain category of sense experience. Consciousness, in early Buddhist teachings, is never an abstract metaphysical construct, it is an observable mental process. 

The dependency of consciousness is explicitly discussed in suttas such as the Great Discourse on the Simile of the Elephant's Footprint in Majjhima Nikāya. 

> *seyyathāpi, āvuso, kaṭṭhañca paṭicca valliñca paṭicca tiṇañca paṭicca mattikañca paṭicca ākāso parivārito agāraṃ tveva saṅkhaṃ gacchati, evameva kho, āvuso, aṭṭhiñca paṭicca nhāruñca paṭicca maṃsañca paṭicca cammañca paṭicca ākāso parivārito rūpaṃ tveva saṅkhaṃ gacchati.* 
> 
> *ajjhattikañceva, āvuso, cakkhuṃ aparibhinnaṃ hoti, bāhirā ca rūpā na āpāthaṃ āgacchanti, no ca tajjo samannāhāro hoti, neva tāva tajjassa viññāṇabhāgassa pātubhāvo hoti. ajjhattikañceva, āvuso, cakkhuṃ aparibhinnaṃ hoti bāhirā ca rūpā āpāthaṃ āgacchanti, no ca tajjo samannāhāro hoti, neva tāva tajjassa viññāṇabhāgassa pātubhāvo hoti. yato ca kho, āvuso, ajjhattikañceva cakkhuṃ aparibhinnaṃ hoti, bāhirā ca rūpā āpāthaṃ āgacchanti, tajjo ca samannāhāro hoti. evaṃ tajjassa viññāṇabhāgassa pātubhāvo hoti.*
> 
> Say, for example, a space enclosed by logs, vines, grass, and clay goes by the name of a 'house'. In the same way, a space enclosed by bones, tendons, meat and skin goes by the name of a 'body'.
> 
> And even if the internal eye is intact, but external visible forms do not come within range, there is no corresponding engagement, and there is no appearance of the corresponding type of consciousness. 
> 
> Even if the internal eye is intact, and external visible forms come within range, but there there is no corresponding engagement, even then there is no appearance of the corresponding type of consciousness. 
> 
> Only when the eye is intact, external visible forms come within range, and there is corresponding engagement, in that case there there is the appearance of the corresponding type of consciousness.
> 
> *MN28 mahāhatthipadopamasuttaṃ*

And likewise for the other senses. 

Let's illustrate this with a simple example. Your eyes are in good working order. There is a something right in front of you, but it is too dark to see, do you see anything? In the language of the suttas, does 'visual consciousness arise'? No. But if your eyes are in good working order, and there is something right in front of you, and there is light enough to see it, will you be aware of see something? Of course. The suttas would say *uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṃ*, 'visual consciousness arises', there is awareness of seeing something.

So let's investigate this within our own experience, seeing that for any conscious experience to occur, the internal and external conditions must be fulfilled, namely a working eye and something to see. Only then is there the consciousness experience of seeing. And exactly the same conditions apply for all the other senses too. 


## Meditation on the conditions for consciousness

Now move back to open awareness. As often as you are able, pick one experience.

Know what type of experience it is, you can name the channel if you want. 

Know the two conditions necessary for this conscious experience to occur, the internal base and the external perceivable object.

Train yourself to be able to do this exercise with any object of experience. 

---

If this analysis gets tiring or difficult, come back to simple open awareness for a minute, calmly knowing what is happening as it is happening. 

You may also find the opposite, that this analysis gives a very powerful boost to the clarity of mindfulness. If that's the case, please continue.

Keep analysing experiences. Know that for consciousness to arise, there are two necessary conditions. Know what those are, and move on.

> *MN148 Chachakkasuttaṃ*

It seems the Buddha created a special meaning for the everyday word *phassa* which literally means 'touch' or 'contact'. In pre-Buddhist literature, the Sanskrit cognate *sparśa* only ever has the meaning of 'touch', 'the sense of touch', and 'sensation'. The Buddha very carefully redefined this word to mean the contact between three things:

1. the sense base
2. the sense object
3. the corresponding consciousness

Hence, the repetition of *tiṇṇaṃ saṅgati phasso*, 'the meeting of the three is contact'. In more conventional English, we could say that *phassa* is a conscious sense experience with three necessary conditions.

When a sense organ, for example the eye, encounters a corresponding object, a visual form, eye consciousness arises. When the three are present, that is called *phassa*. This contact is instantaneous, a composite experience which is the basis for all subsequent mental processing, the arising of a pleasant, unpleasant or neutral feeling tone (*vedanā*), the mental classification according to previous memories (*saññā*), and the intentional activities in response (*saṅkhārā*).

If the eyes are not working, no conscious experience of seeing occurs. 

If forms are not visible, no conscious experience of seeing occurs. 

If consciousness does not arise, for example in deep sleep or when passed out, in a coma, no conscious experience of seeing occurs. 

Only when all three are present does a conscious experience of seeing occur.

Everything that you have ever experienced and will ever experience in your entire life is *phassa*, this meeting of sense organ, sense object and the corresponding consciousness. It is the only reality you have ever known. Let that sink in for a moment. 
## The difference between language and experience
Now we are finally in a position to see how the structure of language differs from the structure of experience. There is no "I", "seeing" and "you", there is merely the meeting of three conditions and a composite experience, which cannot be separated into subject, activity and object, except intellectually. 

Just like water is a composite of oxygen and hydrogen, but if you separate it into its components it is no longer water, in the same way each and every experience is a composite which cannot be separated. If it's missing one of its necessary components, the experience simple does not occur.

It's not like there's an "I" waiting around for experience to happen. The "I" is created by the experience itself. 

Matter has no appearance, we could just say it's just a mass of energy. The appearance is created by the combination of an eye, visible matter and a conscious mind. Without any of those three components, seeing does not occur.

Let's look at *phassa* within the laboratory of subjective experience. 

## Meditation on contact

![[13. Contact.mp3]]

%%
Every single conscious experience is what the Buddha called *phassa*, contact. 

Contact is the convergence of three conditions, the sense base, the sense object and the corresponding consciousness.

Without these conditions in place, there is no experience to be talked about. 

Let's analyse conscious experience of the six sense fields. 

Open your eyes if they are closed and look at something in your visual field. 

This conscious experience of seeing is the *phassa* the Buddha was talking about, the coming together of three conditions.

Just for a moment, analyse the three conditions for this visual experience to take place. For this experience to happen, there must be

1. eyes to see
2. forms that are seen
3. eye consciousness, which knows that are seeing

The eyes, by themselves, see nothing. Forms cannot be seen without the eyes. And there is no eye consciousness independent of the eyes and forms. What you are seeing is the composite of the three. 

Intellectually you can break them apart, but this is a composite experience, if you remove any one condition, the entire experience ends. Test that out by closing your eyes. Or by looking away at something else.

You are not seeing forms out there, but a very neat reconstruction within your own mind. 

Pick another experience in the visual field and analyse it according to these three conditions. 

Each visual experience consists of 1, 2, 3. things. 

Spend some time analysing your visual experiences in this way. 

---

Pick something that you can hear, an experience in the auditory field. 

This too is a composite of three conditions

1. the ear
2. the audible sound vibration
3. ear consciousness, knowing that you are hearing

What you are hearing is not out there, but a reconstruction in your mind. If you remove any one of three conditions, the experience does not occur. 

Pick another sound in your environment and perform the same analysis. What are the three conditions?

Spend some time analysing your auditory experiences in this way.

---

Find something in your environment to smell. 

This experience of smell is a composite of three conditions. 

1. a nose
2. some scented molecules
3. nose consciousness, the mind's ability to know smells

What you are smelling is not 'out there', but a composite, a reconstruction in the mind which is composed of these three things. 

If you remove any one of these three conditions, the experience ends. Test that out by blocking your nose. Or moving away from the smell. 

Pick another smell in your environment and perform the same analysis. 

Spend some time analysing your olfactory experiences in this way.

---

When you are eating or drinking, pay attention to any taste experience which occurs. 

This taste is a composite of three conditions
1. tongue
2. flavoured molecules
3. tongue consciousness, the ability to know flavours

The taste experience is not in your mouth, it is a reconstruction in the mind, made up of these three components. 

If you remove any one of these three conditions, the experience ends. No tongue, no flavours, no tongue consciousness, no tasting.

As you are eating or drinking, keep analysing every taste, identify the three conditions for taste to occur. 

Spend some time analysing your taste experiences in this way.

---

Pay attention to some physical sensation that is occurring in your body. 

This physical feeling is a composite of three conditions. 

1. a body
2. some tangible sensation
3. body consciousness, the ability to know sensations

What you are feeling is not out there, but a composite reconstruction in the mind, made up of these three things. 

If you remove any single condition, the experience ends, or doesn't happen in the first place.

Pick another physical sensation in your body and perform the same analysis. What is this experience of bodily feeling composed of? What are the conditions for it to exist?

Spend some time analysing your tactile experiences in this way.

---

And finally we come to the mind itself. The place where it all happens. 

Pay attention to some mental activity. Your mental mood, or a thought. If mental phenomena are changing too fast to analyse, you can create a thought of goodwill and analyse that. 

This mental experience is composite of three things. 

1. a mind
2. a mental phenomenon
3. mind consciousness, the min's ability to know itself

If you remove any one of those conditions, the experience ends. 

Keep watching your mental experiences and perform the same analysis. What are the necessary conditions for this to occur?

Spend some time analysing your mental experiences in this way.

---

Now come back to open awareness. As often as you are able, pick one experience.

What are three conditions necessary for this conscious experience to occur?

The internal base, the external perceivable object and the corresponding type of consciousness.

Train yourself to be able to do this exercise with any object of experience. 

---

If this analysis gets tiring or difficult, come back to simple open awareness for a while, calmly knowing what is happening as it is happening. 

You may also find the opposite, that this analysis gives a very powerful boost to the clarity of mindfulness. If that's the case, please continue.

---

Keep analysing experiences. Know that for any consciousness experience to arise, there are three necessary conditions. Bring those three conditions to mind.

*tiṇṇaṃ saṅgati phasso*, the meeting of the three is contact. 

Keep analysing contact, each conditioned conscious experience.

# 3.06 Creating the World



> "sabbalokaṃ abhiññāya,
> sabbaloke yathātathaṃ,
> sabbalokavisaṃyutto,
> sabbaloke anūpayo.  
> 
> Deeply understanding the whole world, 
> Everything in the world as it truly is, 
> Disentangled from the whole world, 
> Not drawn into the whole world.
> 
> *ITI112 Itivuttaka 112*


As we are exploring this world of the senses, it should become apparent that the world is not something "out there", but really something that is continually being manufactured "in here". 

We always assume that we're experiencing reality, what I'm seeing is reality, this is what's really out there. What I'm hearing are sounds that exist out in the world, independent of me. Everything that is coming through the senses have, to use the Sanskrit word, *svabhāva*, their own independent existence. This misconception is almost universal, an extremely persistent illusion. 

But as we go deeper into exploring this process of sense experience, it becomes obvious that and we're not experiencing reality, we are experiencing an aspect of something that's really out there, let's say a vibration in the air, which gets filtered through the sense organ of the ear, reduced into a small frequency band, turned into an electrical signal which gets passed onto and processed by the brain, which we have no experience of, until it appears in the mind and gets evaluated according to everything that we've ever experienced previously. That's an entirely different scenario from hearing what's out there. 

In one way, our senses give us a lot of information about the outside world. But another of looking at it is they really *limit* what we experience into a small, narrow band, and bin the rest as irrelevant. 

Do you notice that you hear nothing below 20-25Hz? There's a whole world of frequency there, but we're deaf to it. Do you notice that you hear nothing over 22kHz? Dogs wonder why humans can't hear the loudest and most obvious sounds. So rather than hearing what's out there, we're actually being presented with a small slither of frequency by the ear.

Science tells us how mechanical impulses get converted into electrical impulses in the inner ear, but we have little no experience of that, or what's happening to that electrical signal in the brain. The first time we become aware of it is when the mind manufactures a little theatre set, presenting us with a semi-realistic, internally created scene of something that happened out in the world a few moments earlier. And what's the first thing we do in response to that? Ignore it! Unless of course it's loud enough to capture out attention, or offers some advantage or disadvantage to us. 

Another example. You have the very distinct impression that you're looking out onto the world, but actually the inverse is true, the world is coming into you. Science tells us that light hits the retina and gets converted into some chemical signal, which becomes an electrical signal, which gets processed in the brain somewhere near the back of the head, in darkness and upside down apparently, but that is not available to experience. The first thing that you know about it is when the picture appears in the mind a short time later, a very realistic simulation of looking out onto the world. The illusion is amazingly persistent, despite the fact that we know science and introspection are both saying the same thing, in different ways - you are constructing the world.

So you're never seeing or hearing the world out there, you are seeing and hearing your own locally manufactured facsimile of a small slice of the world out there. That's what you're responding to. That's what you're loving and hating - a reconstructed image in the mind. 

There's been a lot of talk in the last few years about a philosophy called simulation theory, which suggests our reality might be an advanced computer simulation, where what we experience as the physical universe is actually a sophisticated digital construct created by a technologically superior civilisation. In this simulation nothing is real, hence the name, everything is part of the digital simulation.

From a sense point of view there, is no vast digital simulation necessary. We are each living in our own little organic simulation of the world. You manufacture the world in real time as you pass through it, an entirely believable simulation, so real that you actually ascribe qualities of the experiences occurring in your mind to the objects out in the world, going as far as to love and hate the simulated phenomena within your own mind. 

We are living in the age where people are very confident about perceiving the world correctly and perceiving it a certain way, which is obviously a true and accurate reflection of reality. But it should be obvious to any meditator how seemingly rational adults can come to such outrageously different conclusions about what is actually happening in the world. Nobody is seeing anything which even comes close to resembling objective reality. Everybody is creating their own version of the world and taking that as some kind of given truth. What's really amazing is that there is any consensus at all among people, that's much more surprising really!

You might argue that there is an external world, there are overseas countries, people on the other side of the world, other planets and distant galaxies. Certainly there are, and many things outside the range of the senses, and scientific instruments too! But look carefully where the outside world is actually happening. It occurs as a mental phenomenon happening in the mind, as you are thinking about those things. Without the subjective aspect, it simply doesn't exist. 

This is what the Buddha was pointing at when he talked about *sabbaṃ*, all of it, everything. 

> *sabbaṃ vo, bhikkhave, desessāmi. taṃ suṇātha. kiñca, bhikkhave, sabbaṃ? cakkhuñceva rūpā ca, sotañca saddā ca, ghānañca gandhā ca, jivhā ca rasā ca, kāyo ca phoṭṭhabbā ca, mano ca dhammā ca – idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, sabbaṃ. yo, bhikkhave, evaṃ vadeyya – ahametaṃ sabbaṃ paccakkhāya aññaṃ sabbaṃ paññāpessāmī’ti, tassa vācāvatthukamevassa, puṭṭho ca na sampāyeyya, uttariñca vighātaṃ āpajjeyya. taṃ kissa hetu? yathā taṃ, bhikkhave, avisayasminti.*
> 
> Monk's let me tell you about *everything*, Listen carefully. What is *everything*? The eye and forms, the ear and sounds, the nose and scents, the tongue and flavours, the body and tangible sensations, the mind and mental phenomena, this is what's called *everything*. Anyone who says "I reject this everything and will tell you about another everything", that would merely be baseless talk. Questioned further, he would struggle to answer, and would fall into some further difficulty. Why is that? Because it is outside of one's domain.
> 
> *SN35.23 sabbasuttaṃ*

In that same way that a six-piece band can play hundreds, thousands of different pieces of music, these six senses produce all the experiences in our entire life.

A simple question: have you ever experienced a single thing in your entire existence that's outside the field of the six senses? 

The Buddhist version of simulation theory has been around for two and a half thousand years, except it posits that we're living in small organic simulation of the world, produced with bits of the world, which we have never seen independently, on our local hardware. Unlike simulation theory, this kind of simulation is entirely real, and is all you've even known your whole life.

The world doesn't have sights, sights are created by visual frequencies, the eye and the mind. 

The world doesn't have sounds, sounds are created by the audible frequencies, the ear and the mind.

The world doesn't have smells, smells are created by the aromatic chemicals, the nose and the mind. 

The world doesn't have tastes, tastes are created by the taste-able chemicals, the tongue and the mind. 

The world doesn't have tactile sensations, tactile sensations are created by the physical contact, the body and the mind. 

And it goes without saying that all mental phenomena are created by qualia and the mind. 

What we're engaging in here is a process of deconstructing the way that we habitually see the world, in order to see clearly see that we're not really responding to the world, but responding to our internally generated construction of the world. Everyone you have ever loved, everything you have ever hated, everything that you've ever been indifferent to was not out there, you are loving and hating and ignoring your own mind. In a way you are just loving, hating and indifferent to yourself. In another way, it's all just empty phenomena arising and passing away. 

Now you should be able to definitively answer the philosophical question, "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?" Without an ear and ear consciousness, no, of course not. More importantly, there's also no tree and no forest either, without an observer to see them.

Each conscious experience simultaneously creates the illusion of a pre-existing experiencer, experiencing and a pre-existing world. But nothing could be further from the truth. 

[[3.07 Vedanā|Next]]



# 3.07 Vedanā

You may have noticed that everything we are dealing with here is a part of the standard explanation of *paṭiccasamuppāda*, the chain of causation or dependent origination. 

> *... viññāṇapaccayā nāmarūpaṃ, nāmarūpapaccayā saḷāyatanaṃ, saḷāyatanapaccayā phasso, phassapaccayā vedanā, vedanāpaccayā taṇhā ...*

So now we turn to examine the relationship between *phassa* - contact, a conditioned conscious experience - and *vedanā*.

> 
> *MN148 chachakkasuttaṃ*
 
You'll notice I've left *vedanā* untranslated, because so many translations can cause confusion and misunderstanding about *vedanā*. 

*Vedanā* comes from the root *√vid*, which has the meaning 'to know, sense, feel'. It has the *-anā* suffix which creates feminine abstract process nouns, the process of doing something abstract. But before giving a definitive meaning, perhaps it's useful to discuss what *vedanā* *is not*, so that we can clearly understand what it *is*.

*Vedanā* is sometimes translated as 'emotion'. It's definitely not an emotion like anger or sadness, it is much simpler than that. 

*Vedanā* in Sanskrit texts can often mean 'perception'. That is completely unrelated to the Buddhist use of the word. 

In modern Indic languages, *vedanā* can even mean 'pain' or even 'agony'. Again, that's not the primary meaning found in ancient Buddhist texts. 

*Vedanā* is sometimes translated as 'feeling' or 'sensation', which is getting warmer, but is misleading in that *vedanā* is not a feeling or sensation in the body, it is entirely mental. 

So what is *vedanā*, and how does the word get used in the context of the early discourses? Here's a useful definition: In immediate response to every single instance of *phassa*, conscious sense experience, there is a pleasant, unpleasant or neutral feeling tone in the mind. Obviously there is no English word covers the full range of this definition, so perhaps it's best to leave the word untranslated to minimise confusion.

## Some examples of *vedanā*
Think of the warm sun on your skin on a cold day. Notice the feeling in the mind in response to that. The pleasantness that most people experience is *sukha-vedanā*, a pleasant feeling tone in response to the experience. 

What's your least favourite food? Imagine tasting that now. Take a look at your mind, the unpleasantness of the experience is *dukkha-vedanā*, an unpleasant feeling tone in response to the experience.

But by far the most common response to experiences is *adukkham-asukha-vedanā*, a neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling tone in response to an experience. This is sometimes call neutral *vedanā*.

Notice what kind of mental feeling, pleasant, unpleasant or neither, you have associated with the following: 

The sight of a sunset 
The sight of mud
The site of food in the dustbin
The sound of techno
The sound of dogs barking 
The sound of farting
The smell of old books
The smell of fish
The smell of wet grass
The taste of pineapple
The taste of paprika
The taste of celery 
The sensation of knee pain
The sensation of goosebumps
The sensation of an ice-cold shower
The thought of your mother
The thought of the next meal
The thought of tax returns

Every person has a different response to these stimuli. No one is responding to an objective world, everyone is responding to their own subjective experience. It's no wonder that people have wildly divergent responses and opinions when presented with the identical stimulus.

These feelings in the mind in response to sense experience are so subtle that most people are only ever aware of the most extreme pleasant and unpleasant *vedanā*, but with practice it is possible to fine tune awareness to notice ever more subtle *vedanā*, and even learn to distinctly recognise the neutral ones, or more correctly, the absence of pleasantness and unpleasantness.

All meditation on *vedanā* starts with identifying the three types within experience. For example, the Mahāsatipaṭṭhānasutta in Majjhima Nikāya begins the analysis of *vedanā* with:

> *kathañca pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vedanāsu vedanānupassī viharati? idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sukhaṃ vā vedanaṃ vedayamāno sukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayāmī’ti pajānāti, dukkhaṃ vā vedanaṃ vedayamāno dukkhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayāmī’ti pajānāti, adukkhamasukhaṃ vā vedanaṃ vedayamāno adukkhamasukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayāmī’ti pajānāti*  
> 
> And how does a monk remain among *vedanā*, following *vedanā*? Experiencing a comfortable *vedanā*, one knows, "I am experiencing a comfortable *vedanā*." Experiencing an uncomfortable *vedanā*, one knows, "I am experiencing an uncomfortable *vedanā*." Experiencing a neither-uncomfortable-nor-comfortable *vedanā*, one knows, "I am experiencing a neither-uncomfortable-nor-comfortable *vedanā*."
> 
> *MN10 mahāsatipaṭṭhānasuttaṃ, vedanānupassanā*

So let's spend some time tuning into the comfort or discomfort, the pleasantness or unpleasantness of every sense experience. 

This is something that you may never have really paid attention to before, so in the beginning it might be difficult. But don't give up, with practice it becomes easier and easier. In time, more and more subtle *vedanā* become apparent. 

## Meditation on *vedanā*

![[14. Vedanā.mp3]]

%%
As always, come back to your senses. 

Let's begin with open awareness. Simply experience whatever is naturally occurring right now. 

You should be familiar with the types of experiences that you have through the six sense channels. 

And you should be familiar with analysing those experiences in various ways. 

Now we're going to note or label each experience according to the type of *vedanā*. 

There are only three types, pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral. 

Or if you prefer, comfortable, uncomfortable and neither. 

Or in Pāḷi, *sukha*, *dukkha* and *adukkham-asukha*.

This experience you are having right now, what channel is it on? What is the *vedanā*?

If an experience is not obviously pleasant or unpleasant, label it as neutral and move on to the next experience. In time, you may be able to distinguish more subtle levels of pleasantness and unpleasantness, but for now, if you cannot distinguish anything, label it as neutral and move on.

---

For a while, pay attention to the sense of sight. 

When looking at something, any beauty that you might perceive is closely associated with pleasant *vedanā*. 

Any ugliness that you might perceive is closely associated with unpleasant *vedanā*.

But most experiences are neither pleasant nor unpleasant, so label them as neutral for now. 

What are the things around you that you find pleasing, just by looking at them? What is displeasing, just from looking? Move from object to object, and notice the small differences in *vedanā* between each object. Tune in to these subtle differences. 

Spend some time labelling the *vedanā* associated with seeing.

---

Take a listen to the sounds in your environment. 

Which of them are pleasant? Even if there is very subtle enjoyment, notice that. 

Which of the sounds are unpleasant, even in the most subtle way? 

Notice how *vedanā* changes from object to object. 

Notice how some objects seem to have no *vedanā*. Label those as neutral and move on. 

Don't get stuck on any one experience. 

Spend some time labelling the *vedanā* associated with hearing.

---

Tune into the smells in your environment. 

Even subtle smells can have very strong *vedanā*. 

And strong smells can have very weak *vedanā*.

Which smells are pleasing to you? Which ones are displeasing? Which smells are you indifferent to?

Spend some time labelling the *vedanā* associated with smelling.

---

When you have something in your mouth to eat or drink, pay attention to the pleasantness or unpleasantness of every flavour. 

It's normal that flavours that you like will invoke *sukha vedanā*. 

It's normal that flavours that you dislike will be associated with *dukkha vedanā*. 

Pay attention to all the *vedanā* when you are tasting. 

Spend some time labelling the *vedanā* associated with tasting.

---

Tune into bodily experience.

From the top of your head to the tips of your toes, there are a wealth of physical sensations to experience, and each one has associated *vedanā*.

Notice all the physical sensations in your face. 

Some of them may be unpleasant, like a tight brow or tightness around the eyes. 

Some of them may feel good, like smiling cheeks or the lips. 

Many of them will be neutral. Note them as such. 

Move your awareness through your body, noticing the comfort or discomfort associated with every tangible sensation. 

Notice how, when the *vedanā* is neutral, the tendency is to ignore the experience. Pay special attention to those experiences. 

Keep notice *vedanā* everywhere in your body, wherever you put your attention. 

Spend some time labelling the *vedanā* associated with physical feelings.

---

Now we come to the mind. Pay attention to all the mental phenomena that you experience. 

Notice the general mood of mind, the colour of the sky, so to speak. Does that have pleasant, unpleasant or neutral *vedanā*?

Notice how some thoughts are comfortable, some are extremely uncomfortable. Some are totally neutral. IN any case, note the *vedanā*. 

It's strange how we often like to ruminate on thoughts, even those with strong dukkha *vedanā*.

Think of somebody or something that you really don't like. Notice the discomfort in the mind. There is disliking because of the unpleasant *vedanā*.  We'll explore this in more detail shortly. 

Can you bring a thought to mind which immediately creates pleasant *vedanā*?

Just think of something or somebody that you love. The reason you love that is because of the associated pleasant *vedanā*. Not the other way around. 



Keep noticing a world of *vedanā* in the mind. 

Spend some time labelling the *vedanā* associated with mental phenomena.

---
Come back to open awareness, naturally occurring experiences. 

Keep paying attention to the *vedanā* of every prominent experience, especially as you change posture later and move around. Keep noting the three types of *vedanā*.

---

This is the *satipaṭṭhāna* practice of *vedānupassanā*, following the *vedanā* of every experience and using that as a basis to sustain your mindfulness. 

If you keep paying attention to *vedanā*, you will be rewarded for your efforts with some extremely pleasant physical and mental experiences. Even in that case, don't get distracted, keep noting that this is just pleasant *vedanā*. 

---

If you ever get tired of the analysis, notice the *dukkha-vedanā* which are present in the mind. That's what you really are disliking. Nevertheless, give yourself a rest if needed, just come back to knowing the experiences themselves, and let your energy gather there. Once you are ready, start noting the *vedanā* of every experience again. 

---

Build up your stamina, to be able to do this exercise for longer and longer, until eventually you can sustain this awareness of *vedanā* throughout the day. 

---

Every single experience has *vedanā*. This exercise will help you tune into this subtle world of experience and become sensitised to that. 

These subtle aspects of experience are very often below the level of conscious experience for most people. You could say subliminal or subconscious. What we're practising here is to bring them up into the light of conscious awareness.

Doing this will allow you to see what you're really responding to and reacting to. Never the world out there. Everyone and everything that you like and dislike, love and hate is in response to these subtle *vedanā*, these are are the true masters of your whole life.

Keep practising, keep noting the *vedanā* of every experience. 

---

These subtle mental phenomena are what shape your response to life's experiences. Without knowing *vedanā*, and in time mastering your response to *vedanā*, you really are just a puppet of *vedanā*, responding like a robot, with desire for pleasant *vedanā*, with aversion to unpleasant *vedanā*, and being indifferent to and ignoring all neutral *vedanā*. 

---

Please keep training yourself, day and night, to know this subtle mental force of *vedanā* which shapes your entire life.

Keep noting every experience through the six sense channels as pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.

*sukha, dukkha, adukkhamasukha vedanā*

Finally, we come to the sixth group of six in the Chachakkasuttaṃ.

> 
> *MN148 chachakkasuttaṃ*

Now we come to the full picture of how conditioned sense experiences produce a response. The response mentioned here is craving, in Pāḷi *taṇhā*, in Sanskrit *tṛṣṇā*, literally 'thirst'. Used figuratively in this context, it represents the insatiable quality of desire. But desire is just one type of response, aversion is another, and indifference the third common response. Liking, disliking and couldn't care less. 

This is neatly summed up by the awakened nun Dhammadinnā in the Majjhima Nikāya.

> *sukhāya kho, āvuso visākha, vedanāya rāgānusayo anuseti, dukkhāya vedanāya paṭighānusayo anuseti, adukkhamasukhāya vedanāya avijjānusayo anusetī'ti.* 
> 
> Comfortable *vedanā* have the underlying tendency toward desire. Uncomfortable *vedanā* have the underlying tendency toward aversion. Neither-comfortable-nor-uncomfortable *vedanā* have the underlying tendency toward ignorance. 
> 
> *MN44 cūḷavedallasuttaṃ*

You will immediately notice that 'desire, aversion and ignorance' is just another way of saying that the habitual response to *vedanā* is greed, hatred and delusion. 

You have very little control of what type of *vedanā* arises in response to any experience, mostly it is conditioned by a lifetime of previous experiences and responses. And how you respond to the *vedanā* is even more automatic. You will almost always respond to pleasantness with want and desire. You will almost always respond to unpleasantness with aversion and repulsion. And you will almost always respond to neutral *vedanā* with indifference, simply ignoring what is occurring, effectively not knowing and not understanding what is happening. That is the definition of ignorance. 

You may think you are an autonomous human being with free will and the choice to respond to life's experiences as you wish, but mostly you are a puppet of *vedanā*. The push and pull of these subtle feelings in the mind exert the most powerful control over your entire existence. This is some very deep programming that cannot be overcome with mere theoretical understanding or wishful thinking. 

So what's the solution to this deeply ingrained patterning?

> *sukhāya, bhikkhave, vedanāya rāgānusayo pahātabbo, dukkhāya vedanāya paṭighānusayo pahātabbo, adukkhamasukhāya vedanāya avijjānusayo pahātabbo.* 
> 
> *yato kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno sukhāya vedanāya rāgānusayo pahīno hoti, dukkhāya vedanāya paṭighānusayo pahīno hoti, adukkhamasukhāya vedanāya avijjānusayo pahīno hoti, ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, bhikkhu niranusayo sammaddaso acchecchi taṇhaṃ, vivattayi saṃyojanaṃ, sammā mānābhisamayā antamakāsi dukkhassā'ti.*
> 
> In the case of comfortable *vedanā*, the underlying tendency towards desire should be abandoned. In the case of uncomfortable *vedanā*, the underlying underlying tendency toward aversion should be abandoned. In the case of neither-comfortable-nor-uncomfortable *vedanā*, the underlying tendency toward ignorance should be abandoned.
> 
> When this is done, a monk is called free from underlying tendencies, one who sees correctly, he has cut craving and untied the bonds, from the complete comprehension of conceit, he makes an end of suffering. 
> 
> *SN36.3 pahānasuttaṃ*

This is describing nothing less than an arahant, a worthy being who has reached the end of the Buddha's training and found the end of suffering. 

Luckily the Buddha has provided us with a straightforward method to do just this, for those who understand and are willing to do the work. 

The very last sutta in the Majjhima Nikāya gives a detailed exposition on how to cultivate a new response to *vedanā*, how to alter the habitual response of greed, hatred and delusion. It is no magic bullet, but a slow process of reconditioning, response by response.

> *kathañcānanda, ariyassa vinaye anuttarā indriyabhāvanā hoti? idhānanda, bhikkhuno cakkhunā rūpaṃ disvā uppajjati manāpaṃ, uppajjati amanāpaṃ, uppajjati manāpāmanāpaṃ. so evaṃ pajānāti – uppannaṃ kho me idaṃ manāpaṃ, uppannaṃ amanāpaṃ, uppannaṃ manāpāmanāpaṃ. tañca kho saṅkhataṃ oḷārikaṃ paṭiccasamuppannaṃ. etaṃ santaṃ etaṃ paṇītaṃ yadidaṃ – upekkhā’ti. tassa taṃ uppannaṃ manāpaṃ uppannaṃ amanāpaṃ uppannaṃ manāpāmanāpaṃ nirujjhati, upekkhā saṇṭhāti. seyyathāpi, ānanda, cakkhumā puriso ummīletvā vā nimīleyya, nimīletvā vā ummīleyya, evameva kho, ānanda, yassa kassaci evaṃsīghaṃ evaṃtuvaṭaṃ evaṃappakasirena uppannaṃ manāpaṃ uppannaṃ amanāpaṃ uppannaṃ manāpāmanāpaṃ nirujjhati, upekkhā saṇṭhāti. ayaṃ vuccatānanda, ariyassa vinaye anuttarā indriyabhāvanā cakkhuviññeyyesu rūpesu.*
> 
> And what, Ananda is the ultimate development of the sense faculties in the discipline of the Noble One?
> 
> Having seen a form with the eye, pleasantness arises, unpleasantness arises, (neither) pleasantness nor unpleasantness arises. 
> 
> He understands, "This pleasantness has arisen, this unpleasantness has arisen, this (neither) pleasantness nor unpleasantness has arisen. But it is conditioned, coarse, dependently originated. This is peaceful and sublime, namely equanimity."
> 
> For him the arisen pleasantness, the arisen unpleasantness, the arisen (neither) pleasantness nor unpleasantness ceases and equanimity remains.
> 
> Just like a sighted person would blink their eyes and open them again, in the same way, just as fast, just as quickly, with as little difficulty, the arisen pleasantness, the arisen unpleasantness, the arisen (neither) pleasantness nor unpleasantness ceases for someone and equanimity remains.
> 
> This is called the ultimate development of the sense faculties in the discipline of the Noble One with regard to visible forms. 
>
> *MN152 indriyabhāvanāsuttaṃ*

The same is repeated for the other five senses. There's a lot going on here, so let's break it down. 

1. Know a sense experience has occurred through one of the six channels 
2. Know the *vedanā* which has occurred in response
3. Understand the *vedanā* is fabricated, gross and conditioned
4. Watch the *vedanā* end with a perfectly balanced, non-reactive mind.
5. Experiences rise and pass but only equanimity remains. 

Through all the previous sections of this course, we have been building up to be able to see this clearly - The occurrence of a sense experience, knowing which channel it occurs on, knowing the type of vedanā which arises, and understanding the dependent nature of the whole experience. Being practised in all these skills, it is possible to fulfil the last step, which is to watch the experience with such a balanced mind that no reaction takes place, the experience ends and only equanimity persists. 

The balanced reaction to each and every sense experience is represented by similes which give the impression of a small task being quickly and easily performed.

1. Just like a sighted person would blink their eyes and open them again ... just as quickly, one develops equanimity to sights.

2. Just like a strong person would snap their fingers without any difficulty ... just as quickly, one develops equanimity to sounds.

3. Just like a drop of water rolls off a slightly sloping lotus leaf ... just as quickly, one develops equanimity to smells.

4. Just like a strong person would collect a ball of saliva on the tip of their tongue and spit it out without any difficulty ... just as quickly, one develops equanimity to flavours.

5. Just like a strong person would bend their arm forwards or backwards ... just as quickly, one develops equanimity to physical sensations.

6. Just like two or three drops of water falling into an iron pan heated in the midday sun would sizzle away and disappear ... just as quickly, one develops equanimity to mental phenomena. 

So that's enough in theory, let's look at how to do this in practice. 

## Meditation on cultivating equanimity

![[15. Cultivating Equanimity.mp3]]

%%
Come back to your senses. 

Be aware of whatever sense experience is happening right now.

Is the experience comfortable, uncomfortable, or neither. Label it as such. 

The habitual reaction to comfortable experience is to like it, to want more of it. Now you're actively going to cultivate a different reaction to pleasant experiences, that is non-reaction, just knowing it with equanimity. 

The habitual reaction to uncomfortable experience is to dislike it, to want less of it, make it go away. Now you're actively going to cultivate a different reaction to unpleasant experiences, that is non-reaction, just knowing it with equanimity. 

The habitual reaction to neither comfortable nor uncomfortable experience is to ignore it, to be unaware of it. Now you're actively going to cultivate a different reaction to these neutral experiences, that is non-reaction, just knowing it with equanimity.

---

When seeing, as fast as you can blink, respond to pleasant, unpleasant and neutral *vedanā* with equanimity, just experiencing them with a balanced mind. 

When hearing, as fast as you can snap your fingers, respond to pleasant, unpleasant and neutral *vedanā* with equanimity, just experiencing them with a balanced mind. 

When smelling, as fast as water rolls off a lotus leaf, respond to pleasant, unpleasant and neutral *vedanā* with equanimity, just experiencing them with a balanced mind. 

When tasting, as fast as you can spit something out, respond to pleasant, unpleasant and neutral *vedanā* with equanimity, just experiencing them with a balanced mind. 

When feeling physical sensations, as fast as you can bend your arm, respond to pleasant, unpleasant and neutral *vedanā* with equanimity, just experiencing them with a balanced mind. 

When experiencing mental phenomena, as fast as a drop of water evaporates on a hot plate, respond to pleasant, unpleasant and neutral *vedanā* with equanimity, just experiencing them with a balanced mind. 

Experience by experience, it makes no different which sense channel the experience is occurring on, it makes no different whether it is comfortable, uncomfortable or neutral, your job is to know it in the most balanced way possible, just looking on with equanimity. 

Knowing every *vedanā*, respond to every one with a completely balanced mind.

---

When experiencing pleasant *vedanā*, don't give craving a chance. Don't let desire take root. Keep the mind balanced in response. 

When experiencing unpleasant *vedanā*, don't give aversion a chance. Don't let dislike take root. Keep the mind balanced in response. 

When experiencing neutral *vedanā*, don't give ignorance a chance. Don't let delusion take root. Keep the mind balanced in response. 

---

This is the most simple yet profound practice to alter the way you respond to reality. 

Not having each and every experience coloured and clouded by greed, hatred and delusion will allow you to see more clearly, more objectively, more in line with reality. 

---

The practice is simple, but maintaining it is difficult. So make a special effort to continue throughout the day and into the night, knowing each experience, fully experiencing each *phassa*, every *vedanā* with a non-reactive mind. 

This is the noble practice of *indriyabhāvanā*, cultivating equanimity to each and every experience. 

---

Keep knowing every experience and responding with perfect mental balance. 

Experience by experience, it is possible to change this deeply ingrained pattern of response. 

Don't be a slave of *vedanā* any longer. Don't let this invisible force exert its hidden power over you. Instead of responding to *vedanā* with greed, with hatred, with delusion, responded with a perfectly calm, balanced mind. 

This is the training in cultivating equanimity. Keep practising.

# 4.01 Emptiness

At last we come to the heart of the matter. 

> *cakkhu attā’ti yo vadeyya taṃ na upapajjati. cakkhussa uppādopi vayopi paññāyati. yassa kho pana uppādopi vayopi paññāyati, ‘attā me uppajjati ca veti cā’ti iccassa evamāgataṃ hoti. tasmā taṃ na upapajjati – ‘cakkhu attā’ti yo vadeyya. iti cakkhu anattā.*
> 
> Whoever says, "I am the eye / The eye is me", that is unacceptable. The coming into being and disappearance of the eye is evident. Then one would have to conclude, "I am coming into being and disappearing". Therefore it is unacceptable to say "I am the eye / The eye is me". The eye is impersonal.
> 
> *MN 148 chachakkasuttaṃ*

By the same logic, the sutta goes on to discuss every aspect of six sense experience from the same logic. 

> Whoever says, "I am visible forms / visible forms are me" ... 
> 
> Whoever says, "I am eye consciousness / eye consciousness is me" ... 
> 
> Whoever says, "I am visual experience / visual experience is me" ...
> 
> Whoever says, "I am vedanā / vedanā is me" ...
> 
> Whoever says, "I am craving / craving is me", that is unacceptable. The coming into being and disappearance of the craving is evident. Then one would have to conclude, "I am coming into being and disappearing". Therefore it is unacceptable to say "I am craving / craving is me". Craving is impersonal.

What is this sutta emphasising? If the process of experience is entirely made out of parts, and all those parts are dependent on each other, then it's impossible for one of the parts to be some kind of permanent essence or Self. And yet, this is exactly what we believe. It doesn't matter if you come from an Abrahamic religion and believe in a soul, or follow Hindu ideas and believe in a Higher Self, or even be a scientific atheist with no belief. Still, we almost all believe and acts as if there's a self right here in experience, an *experiencer* if you will. Nobody even questions the validity of this belief, it seems to be a self-evident truth. But when you analyse experience, subjectively or objectively, it turns out to be a false idea, an unfounded belief. 

We consider ourselves to be rational human beings, and yet this magical belief of an experiencing self persists, despite all evidence to the contrary. There certainly is the illusion of a continuous self that's experiencing the objective material world, and having this inner subjective experience, but when you zoom into experience, you can clearly see it is made out of component parts, and that there's no self hiding within any of the parts, or outside the parts. 

Without any investigation, almost all of us take consciousness to be some kind of continuous entity, our true being. "Sure consciousness keeps changing," one might say, "yet I'm still the same person". But if you put consciousness under the spotlight, it becomes obvious that it is completely dependent on things which are very clearly not oneself, leading to the ridiculous situation mentioned in the sutta above, where one's self must be arising and passing away on the whims of impersonal external objects. 

The other thing which we really take to be our self are our wishes, wants, desires and loves. And on the opposite side, our dislikes, grudges, grievances and hatreds. Even the smallest preferences are taken as part of oneself. Nothing could be more personal than what one loves and hates, surely? And yet an investigation of *vedanā* clearly shows that all one's likes and dislikes are based on the impersonal push and pull of feelings in the mind which arise due to their own causes and conditions. So even our personal desires turn out to be highly impersonal and conditioned by external forces. 

Another important point that becomes clear from examining experience is this: the world that we all think of as 'out there' turns out to be a very much constructed 'in here'. There is no way to separate the visual form 'out there', from the eye that sees and the consciousness that knows it is seeing. All of its beauty and ugliness turns out to the result of *vedanā* within one's mind, not qualities of the world outside. The experience is full of colour and shapes, but completely empty of the one thing that matters, a self, an I, a me, mine, anything that can belong to a self.

This is precisely the question Ananda asks the Buddha about in this sutta from the Saḷāyatana-saṃyutta in the Saṃyutta Nikāya. 

> *suñño loko, suñño loko’ti, bhante, vuccati. kittāvatā nu kho, bhante, suñño lokoti vuccat'ti?* 
> 
> *yasmā ca kho, ānanda, suññaṃ attena vā attaniyena vā tasmā suñño lokoti vuccati.* 
> 
> *kiñca, ānanda, suññaṃ attena vā attaniyena vā? cakkhu kho, ānanda, suññaṃ attena vā attaniyena vā. rūpā suññā attena vā attaniyena vā, cakkhuviññāṇaṃ suññaṃ attena vā attaniyena vā, cakkhusamphasso suñño attena vā attaniyena vā,yampidaṃ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ tampi suññaṃ attena vā attaniyena vā.*
> 
> Bhante, it is said, "The world is empty, the world is empty. In what way is the world empty?"
> 
> Because, Ananda, the world is empty of a self or anything related to a self, that's why it is said, "The world is empty."
> 
> And what is empty of a self or anything related to a self? The eye... forms ... eye consciousness... visual experience... all that is felt, pleasant or unpleasant, based on visual experience, that too is is empty of a self or anything related to a self. 
> 
> (And likewise for all the other senses including mind)
> 
> *SN35.85 suññatalokasuttaṃ*

The first thing to notice about this sutta is that the Buddha describes the world not as the world 'out there', but as the subjective world of experience. That's the only world anybody actually knows. And while this world is full of experiential phenomena, it's truly empty of a self, empty of any essence, empty of any entity, empty of any soul, empty of any kind of lasting being. 

This idea of emptiness can really freak some people out. They think, "Before I had an I, now it doesn't seem to exist any more. Where did I go!? What happened to me!?" But there never was an I, there never was a me, it was always just empty experience. Others leap towards this idea of emptiness, because they understand the simple truth of it. This is what's happening now, this is what's always been happening, just empty experience arising and passing away. When nothing to hold on to, the mind can let go. 

> *sabbe dhammā anattā'ti,*
> *yadā paññāya passati,*
> *atha nibbindati dukkhe,*
> *esa maggo visuddhiyā.*
> 
> All phenomena are impersonal,
> when one sees this with wisdom,
> then one becomes dis-enchanted with suffering,
> this is the path to purification. 
> 
> *DHP20 Dhammpada verse 279*

This verse from the Dhammapada highlights the point. We are so enchanted by the idea of a self that we end up clinging onto impersonal experiences as I, me, mine, mistaking them to be a self. Ultimately, clinging onto something that isn't really one's own to possess just causes endless amounts of hardship and suffering. 

When you see this with the eye of wisdom, how all things inside and outside are completely impersonal, the illusion breaks. You see that dragging an imaginary self and all its possessions around is a huge burden, an unnecessary stress. Not taking that heavy burden to be oneself, you can drop the weight to the ground, lighten the load and get relief. 

Holding on to a sense of self is merely holding onto *dukkha*. Letting go of the sense of self is merely letting go of *dukkha*. Everything else continues as normal. 

When you realise that the thing you are gripping so tightly is causing you suffering, you drop it naturally, like a burning coal. Nobody needs to tell you to drop something hot. And yet, in a way, that's what we're all doing - clinging tightly onto the very thing which is the source of the pain. 

This practice helps to provide a vivid, clear understanding of the process by which suffering is being created. Understanding how *dukkha* is made, it becomes possible to stop making it. 

## Where does the practice go?
"Where does this practice go?", you may ask. 

To find out, let's take it for a test drive. What happens when you see the world as empty? What happens when you let go of taking this world of experiences as I, as me, as mine? Most people experience an incredible sense of relief. It's such a great feeling to put down the invisible weight that you've been carrying around unnecessarily as long as you can remember. It's a heavy load, dragging an imaginary self through existence.

# 5.01 Suttas on Training

All translations by Bhikkhu Bodhi, unless otherwise specified. 

## DN11 kevaṭṭasuttaṃ  (excerpt)
On the three types of miracles. 

'Kevaddha, there are three kinds of miracle that I have declared, having realised them by my own insight. Which three? The miracle of psychic power, the miracle of telepathy, the miracle of instruction.

–7'What is the miracle of psychic power? Here, Kevaddha, a monk displays various psychic powers in different ways. Being one he becomes many, he becomes many and having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space; he dives in and out of the earth as if it were water; he walks on water without sinking as if it were earth; sitting cross-legged he travels through space like a winged bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the sun and the moon, so mighty and powerful; he exercises mastery over the body as far as the Brahma-world.

Then someone who has faith and trust sees him doing these things.

'He tells this to someone else who is sceptical and unbelieving, saying: "It is wonderful, sir, it is marvellous, the great power and skill of that ascetic …" And that man might say: "Sir, there is something called the Gandhāra charm. It is by means of this that that monk becomes many…"

What do you think, Kevaddha, would not a sceptic say that to a believer?' 'He would, Lord.' 'And that is why, Kevaddha, seeing the danger of such miracles, I dislike, reject and despise them.

Knowing Another's Mind
–11'And what is the miracle of telepathy? Here, a monk reads the minds of other beings, of other people, reads their mental states, their thoughts and ponderings, and says: "That is how your mind is, that is how it inclines, that is in your heart." Then someone who has faith and trust sees him doing these things.

–13'He tells this to someone else who is sceptical and unbelieving, saying: "It is wonderful, sir, it is marvellous, the great power and skill of that ascetic …" And that man might say: "Sir, there is something called the Manika charm. It is by means of this that that monk can read the minds of others …" And that is why, seeing the danger of such miracles, I… despise them.

Instruction
'And what is the miracle of instruction? Here, Kevaddha, a monk gives instruction as follows: "Consider in this way, don't consider in that, direct your mind this way, not that way, give up that, gain this and persevere in it." That, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction.

## MN53: Sekhasutta - A Trainee

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha's Park.

Now on that occasion a new assembly hall had recently been built for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu and it had not yet been inhabited by any recluse or brahmin or human being at all. Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and said to him:

"Venerable sir, a new assembly hall has recently been built here for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu and it has not yet been inhabited by any recluse or brahmin or human being at all. Venerable sir, let the Blessed One be the first to use it. When the Blessed One has used it first, then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu will use it afterwards. That will lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time."

The Blessed One consented in silence. Then, when they saw that he had consented, they got up from their seats, and after paying homage to him, keeping him on their right, they went to the assembly hall. They covered it completely with coverings and prepared seats, and they put out a large water jug and hung up an oil-lamp. Then they went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, they stood at one side and said:

"Venerable sir, the assembly hall has been covered completely with coverings and seats have been prepared, a large water jug has been put out and an oil-lamp hung up. Let the Blessed One come at his own convenience."

Then the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he went with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus to the assembly hall. When he arrived, he washed his feet and then entered the hall and sat down by the central pillar facing the east. And the bhikkhus washed their feet and then entered the hall and sat down by the western wall facing the east, with the Blessed One before them. And the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu washed their feet and entered the hall and sat down by the eastern wall facing the west, with the Blessed One before them.

Then, when the Blessed One had instructed, urged, roused, and gladdened the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu with talk on the Dhamma for much of the night, he said to the venerable Ānanda:

"Ānanda, speak to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu about the disciple in higher training who has entered upon the way. My back is uncomfortable. I will rest it."

"Yes, venerable sir," the venerable Ānanda replied.

Then the Blessed One prepared his patchwork cloak folded in four and lay down on his right side in the lion's pose, with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and fully aware, after noting in his mind the time for rising.

Then the venerable Ānanda addressed Mahānāma the Sakyan thus:

"Mahānāma, here a noble disciple is possessed of virtue, guards the doors of his sense faculties, is moderate in eating, and devoted to wakefulness; he possesses seven good qualities; and he is one who obtains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now.

"And how is a noble disciple possessed of virtue? Here a noble disciple is virtuous, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the Pātimokkha, he is perfect in conduct and resort, and seeing fear in the slightest fault, he trains by undertaking the training precepts. This is how a noble disciple is possessed of virtue.

"And how does a noble disciple guard the doors of his sense faculties? On seeing a form with the eye, a noble disciple does not grasp at its signs and features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him, he practises the way of its restraint, he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear … On smelling an odour with the nose … On tasting a flavour with the tongue … On touching a tangible with the body … on cognizing a mind-object with the mind, a noble disciple does not grasp at its signs and features. Since, if he left the mind faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him, he practises the way of its restraint, he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty. That is how a noble disciple guards the doors of his sense faculties.

"And how is a noble disciple moderate in eating? Here, reflecting wisely, a noble disciple takes food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the endurance and continuance of this body, for ending discomfort, and for assisting the holy life, considering: ‘Thus I shall terminate old feelings without arousing new feelings and I shall be healthy and blameless and shall live in comfort.’ That is how a noble disciple is moderate in eating.

"And how is a noble disciple devoted to wakefulness? Here, during the day, while walking back and forth and sitting, a noble disciple purifies his mind of obstructive states. In the first watch of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind of obstructive states. In the middle watch of the night he lies down on the right side in the lion's pose with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and fully aware, after noting in his mind the time for rising. After rising, in the third watch of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind of obstructive states. That is how a noble disciple is devoted to wakefulness.

"And how does a noble disciple possess seven good qualities? Here a noble disciple has faith; he places his faith in the Tathāgata's enlightenment thus: ‘The Blessed One is accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.’

"He has shame; he is ashamed of misconduct in body, speech, and mind, ashamed of engaging in evil unwholesome deeds.

"He has fear of wrongdoing; he is afraid of misconduct in body, speech, and mind, afraid of engaging in evil unwholesome deeds.

"He has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and consolidates what he has learned. Such teachings as are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, and affirm a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure — such teachings as these he has learned much of, remembered, recited verbally, investigated with the mind and penetrated well by view.

"He is energetic in abandoning unwholesome states and in undertaking wholesome states; he is steadfast, firm in striving, not remiss in developing wholesome states.

"He has mindfulness; he possesses the highest mindfulness and skill; he recalls and recollects what was done long ago and spoken long ago.

"He is wise; he possesses wisdom regarding rise and disappearance that is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. That is how a noble disciple possesses seven good qualities.

"And how is a noble disciple one who obtains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now? Here, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a noble disciple enters upon and abides in the first jhāna … With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he enters upon and abides in the second jhāna … With the fading away as well of rapture … he enters upon and abides in the third jhāna … With the abandoning of pleasure and pain … he enters upon and abides in the fourth jhāna, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. That is how a noble disciple is one who obtains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now.

"When a noble disciple has thus become one who is possessed of virtue, who guards the doors of his sense faculties, who is moderate in eating, who is devoted to wakefulness, who possesses seven good qualities, who obtains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now, he is called one in higher training who has entered upon the way. His eggs are unspoiled; he is capable of breaking out, capable of enlightenment, capable of attaining the supreme security from bondage.

"Suppose there were a hen with eight or ten or twelve eggs, which she had covered, incubated, and nurtured properly. Even though she did not wish: ‘Oh, that my chicks might pierce their shells with the points of their claws and beaks and hatch out safely!’ yet the chicks are capable of piercing their shells with the points of their claws and beaks and hatching out safely. So too, when a noble disciple has thus become one who is possessed of virtue … he is called one in higher training who has entered upon the way. His eggs are unspoiled; he is capable of breaking out, capable of enlightenment, capable of attaining the supreme security from bondage.

"Based upon that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is due to equanimity, this noble disciple recollects his manifold past lives … Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives. This is his first breaking out like that of the hen's chicks from their shells.

"Based upon that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is due to equanimity, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, this noble disciple sees beings passing away and reappearing … he understands how beings pass on according to their actions. This is his second breaking out like that of the hen's chicks from their shells.

"Based upon that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is due to equanimity, by realising for himself with direct knowledge, this noble disciple here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints. This is his third breaking out like that of the hen's chicks from their shells.

"When a noble disciple is possessed of virtue, that pertains to his conduct. When he guards the doors of his sense faculties, that pertains to his conduct. When he is moderate in eating, that pertains to his conduct. When he is devoted to wakefulness, that pertains to his conduct. When he possesses seven good qualities, that pertains to his conduct. When he is one who obtains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now, that pertains to his conduct.

"When he recollects his manifold past lives … with their aspects and particulars, that pertains to his true knowledge. When, with the divine eye … he sees beings passing away and reappearing and understands how beings pass on according to their actions, that pertains to his true knowledge. When, by realising for himself with direct knowledge, he here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints, that pertains to his true knowledge.

"This noble disciple is thus said to be perfect in true knowledge, perfect in conduct, perfect in true knowledge and conduct.

And this stanza was uttered by the Brahmā Sanankumāra:

‘The noble clan is held to be
The best of people as to lineage;
But best of gods and humans is one
Perfect in true knowledge and conduct.’

"Now that stanza was well sung by the Brahmā Sanankumāra, not ill sung; it was well spoken, not ill spoken; it has a meaning, and is not meaningless; and it was approved by the Blessed One."

Then the Blessed One rose and addressed the venerable Ānanda thus: "Good, good, Ānanda! It is good that you have spoken to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu about the disciple in higher training who has entered upon the way."

That is what the venerable Ānanda said. The Teacher approved. The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu were satisfied and delighted in the venerable Ānanda's words.


## MN10: Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta - The Foundations of Mindfulness (excerpt)

Contemplation of the Body
. Mindfulness of Breathing
"And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu abide contemplating the body as a body? Here a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect, and established mindfulness in front of him, ever mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out. Breathing in long, he understands: ‘I breathe in long’; or breathing out long, he understands: ‘I breathe out long.’ Breathing in short, he understands: ‘I breathe in short’; or breathing out short, he understands: ‘I breathe out short.’

He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body.’

He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in tranquillising the bodily formation’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillising the mation’ ; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillising the bodily formation.’

Just as a skilled lathe-operator or his apprentice, when making a long turn, understands: ‘I make a long turn’; or, when making a short turn, understands: ‘I make a short turn’; so too, breathing in long, a bhikkhu understands: ‘I breathe in long’ … he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillising the bodily formation.’

Insight
"In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally, or he abides contemplating the body as a body externally, or he abides contemplating the body as a body both internally and externally. Or else he abides contemplating in the body its nature of arising, or he abides contemplating in the body its nature of vanishing, or he abides contemplating in the body its nature of both arising and vanishing.
 Or else mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness. And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body.

. The Four Postures
"Again, bhikkhus, when walking, a bhikkhu understands: ‘I am walking’; when standing, he understands: ‘I am standing’; when sitting, he understands: ‘I am sitting’; when lying down, he understands: ‘I am lying down’; or he understands accordingly however his body is disposed.

"In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally, externally, and both internally and externally … And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body.

. Full Awareness
"Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is one who acts in full awareness when going forward and returning; who acts in full awareness when looking ahead and looking away; who acts in full awareness when flexing and extending his limbs; who acts in full awareness when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl; who acts in full awareness when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; who acts in full awareness when defecating and urinating; who acts in full awareness when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent.

"In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally, externally, and both internally and externally … And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body.

## MN148: Chachakkasutta - The Six Sets of Six
The sutta upon which this course is based.

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." — "Venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, I shall teach you the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; I shall reveal a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure, that is, the six sets of six. Listen and attend closely to what I shall say." — "Yes, venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

Synopsis
"The six internal bases should be understood. The six external bases should be understood. The six classes of consciousness should be understood. The six classes of contact should be understood. The six classes of feeling should be understood. The six classes of craving should be understood.

Enumeration
i "‘The six internal bases should be understood.’ So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? There are the eye-base, the ear-base, the nose-base, the tongue-base, the body-base, and the mind-base. So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘The six internal bases should be understood.’ This is the first set of six.

ii "‘The six external bases should be understood.’ So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? There are the form-base, the sound-base, the odour-base, the flavour-base, the tangible-base, and the mind-object-base. So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘The six external bases should be understood. ’ This is the second set of six.

iii "‘The six classes of consciousness should be understood. ’ So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? Dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises; dependent on the ear and sounds, ear-consciousness arises; dependent on the nose and odours, nose-consciousness arises; dependent on the tongue and flavours, tongue-consciousness arises; dependent on the body and tangibles, body-consciousness arises; dependent on the mind and mind-objects, mind-consciousness arises. So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘The six classes of consciousness should be understood.’ This is the third set of six.

iv "‘The six classes of contact should be understood.’ So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? Dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact. Dependent on the ear and sounds, ear-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact. Dependent on the nose and odours, nose-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact. Dependent on the tongue and flavours, tongue-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact. Dependent on the body and tangibles, body-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact. Dependent on the mind and mind-objects, mind-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact. So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘The six classes of contact should be understood. ’ This is the fourth set of six.

v "‘The six classes of feeling should be understood.’ So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? Dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling. Dependent on the ear and sounds, ear-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling. Dependent on the nose and odours, nose-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling. Dependent on the tongue and flavours, tongue-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling. Dependent on the body and tangibles, body-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling. Dependent on the mind and mind-objects, mind-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling. So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘The six classes of feeling should be understood. ’ This is the fifth set of six.

vi "‘The six classes of craving should be understood.’ So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? Dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling; with feeling as condition there is craving. Dependent on the ear and sounds, ear-consciousness arises … with feeling as condition there is craving. Dependent on the nose and odours, nose-consciousness arises … with feeling as condition there is craving. Dependent on the tongue and flavours, tongue-consciousness arises … with feeling as condition there is craving. Dependent on the body and tangibles, body-consciousness arises … with feeling as condition there is craving. Dependent on the mind and mind-objects, mind-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling; with feeling as condition there is craving. So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘The six classes of craving should be understood.’ This is the sixth set of six.

Demonstration of not Self
i "If anyone says, ‘The eye is self,’ that is not tenable. The rise and fall of the eye are discerned, and since its rise and fall are discerned, it would follow: ‘My self rises and falls.’ That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘The eye is self.’ Thus the eye is not self.

"If anyone says, ‘Forms are self’[n.1332] The full argument of the previous paragraph is repeated for each of the remaining five terms in each set of six. The rise and fall of the forms are discerned, and since its rise and fall are discerned, it would follow: ‘My self rises and falls.’ That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Forms are self.’ Thus the eye is not self, forms are not self.

"If anyone says, ‘Eye-consciousness is self’ The rise and fall of the eye-consciousness is discerned, and since its rise and fall is discerned, it would follow: ‘My eye-consciousness rises and falls.’ Thus eye-consciousness is not self. That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Eye-consciousness is self.’ Thus the eye is not self, forms are not self, eye-consciousness is not self.

"If anyone says, ‘Eye-contact is self’ The rise and fall of the eye-contact is discerned, and since its rise and fall is discerned, it would follow: ‘My eye-contact rises and falls.’ That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Eye-contact is self.’ Thus the eye is not self, forms are not self, eye-consciousness is not self, eye-contact is not self.

"If anyone says, ‘Feeling is self’ The rise and fall of the feeling is discerned, and since its rise and fall is discerned, it would follow: ‘My feeling rises and falls.’ That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Feeling is self.’ Thus the eye is not self, forms are not self, eye-consciousness is not self, eye-contact is not self, feeling is not self.

"If anyone says, ‘Craving is self’ The rise and fall of craving is discerned, and since its rise and fall is discerned, it would follow: ‘My craving rises and falls.’ That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Craving is self.’ Thus the eye is not self, forms are not self, eye-consciousness is not self, eye-contact is not self, feeling is not self, craving is not self.

ii "If anyone says, ‘The ear is self,’ … If anyone says, ‘The nose is self,’ … "If anyone says, ‘The tongue is self,’ … "If anyone says, ‘The body is self,’ … "If anyone says, ‘The mind is self,’ … The rise and fall of mind is discerned, and since its rise and fall is discerned, it would follow: ‘My mind rises and falls.’ That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Mind is self.’ Thus the mind is not self.

–20"If anyone says, ‘Mind-objects are self,’ … ‘Mind-consciousness is self,’ … ‘Mind-contact is self,’ … ‘Feeling is self,’ … … ‘Craving is self’ … That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Craving is self.’ Thus the mind is not self, mind-objects are not self, mind-consciousness is not self, mind-contact is not self, feeling is not self, craving is not self.

The Origination of Identity
"Now, bhikkhus, this is the way leading to the origination of identity. i One regards the eye thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ One regards forms thus … One regards eye-consciousness thus … One regards eye-contact thus … One regards feeling thus … One regards craving thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’

ii–vi "One regards the ear thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ … One regards the nose thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ … One regards the tongue thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ … One regards the body thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ … One regards the mind thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ One regards mind-objects thus … One regards mind-consciousness thus … One regards mind-contact thus … One regards feeling thus … One regards craving thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’

The Cessation of Identity
"Now, bhikkhus, this is the way leading to the cessation of identity. (i) One regards the eye thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ One regards forms thus … One regards eye-consciousness thus … One regards eye-contact thus … One regards feeling thus … One regards craving thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

(ii –vi) "One regards the ear thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ … One regards the nose thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ … One regards the tongue thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ … One regards the body thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ … One regards the mind thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ One regards mind-objects thus … One regards mind-consciousness thus … One regards mind-contact thus … One regards feeling thus … One regards craving thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

The Underlying Tendencies
i "Bhikkhus, dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there arises a feeling felt as pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant. When one is touched by a pleasant feeling, if one delights in it, welcomes it, and remains holding to it, then the underlying tendency to lust lies within one. When one is touched by a painful feeling, if one sorrows, grieves and laments, weeps beating one's breast and becomes distraught, then the underlying tendency to aversion lies within one. When one is touched by a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, if one does not understand as it actually is the origination, the disappearance, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to that feeling, then the underlying tendency to ignorance lies within one. Bhikkhus, that one shall here and now make an end of suffering without abandoning the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling, without abolishing the underlying tendency to aversion towards painful feeling, without extirpating the underlying tendency to ignorance in regard to neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, without abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge — this is impossible.

ii –vi "Bhikkhus, dependent on the ear and sounds, ear-consciousness arises … Dependent on the mind and mind-objects, mind-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there arises a feeling felt as pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant … Bhikkhus, that one should here and now make an end of suffering without abandoning the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling … without abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge — this is impossible.

The Abandonment of the Underlying Tendencies
i "Bhikkhus, dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there arises a feeling felt as pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant. When one is touched by a pleasant feeling, if one does not delight in it, welcome it, and remain holding to it, then the underlying tendency to lust does not lie within one. When one is touched by a painful feeling, if one does not sorrow, grieve and lament, does not weep beating one's breast and become distraught, then the underlying tendency to aversion does not lie within one. When one is touched by a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, if one understands as it actually is the origination, the disappearance, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to that feeling, then the underlying tendency to ignorance does not lie within one. Bhikkhus, that one shall here and now make an end of suffering by abandoning the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling, by abolishing the underlying tendency to aversion towards painful feeling, by extirpating the underlying tendency to ignorance in regard to neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge — this is possible.

–30ii –vi "Bhikkhus, dependent on the ear and sounds, ear-consciousness arises … Dependent on the mind and mind-objects, mind-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there arises a feeling felt as pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant … Bhikkhus, that one shall here and now make an end of suffering by abandoning the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling … by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge — this is possible.

Liberation
"Seeing thus, bhikkhus, a well-taught noble disciple becomes disenchanted with the eye, disenchanted with forms, disenchanted with eye-consciousness, disenchanted with eye-contact, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with craving.

"He becomes disenchanted with the ear … He becomes disenchanted with the nose … He becomes disenchanted with the tongue … He becomes disenchanted with the body … He becomes disenchanted with the mind, disenchanted with mind-objects, disenchanted with mind-consciousness, disenchanted with mind-contact, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with craving.

"Being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion his mind is liberated. When it is liberated, there comes the knowledge: ‘It is liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’"

That is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words. Now while this discourse was being spoken, through not clinging the minds of sixty bhikkhus were liberated from the taints.
## SN48:42 The Brahmin Uṇṇabha
On the five sense, the mind, mindfulness, liberation and Nibbāna. 

At Sāvatthī. Then the brahmin Uṇṇabha approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Master Gotama, these five faculties have different domains, different resorts; they do not experience each others’ resort and domain. What five? The eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, the body faculty. Now, Master Gotama, as these five faculties have different domains, different resorts, and do not experience each others’ resort and domain, what is it that they take recourse in? And what is it that experiences their resort and domain?"

"Brahmin, these five faculties have different domains, different resorts; they do not experience each others’ resort and domain. What five? The eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, the body faculty. Now, brahmin, these five faculties having different domains, different resorts, not experiencing each others’ resort and domain—they take recourse in the mind, and the mind experiences their resort and domain."

"But, Master Gotama, what is it that the mind takes recourse in?"

"The mind, brahmin, takes recourse in mindfulness."

"But, Master Gotama, what is it that mindfulness takes recourse in?"

"Mindfulness, brahmin, takes recourse in liberation."

"But, Master Gotama, what is it that liberation takes recourse in?"

"Liberation, brahmin, takes recourse in Nibbāna."

"But, Master Gotama, what is it that Nibbāna takes recourse in?"

"You have gone beyond the range of questioning, brahmin. You weren’t able to grasp the limit to questioning. For, brahmin, the holy life is lived with Nibbāna as its ground, Nibbāna as its destination, Nibbāna as its final goal."

Then the brahmin Uṇṇabha, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One's statement, rose from his seat and paid homage to the Blessed One, after which he departed keeping him on his right.

Then, not long after the brahmin Uṇṇabha had departed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:

"Bhikkhus, suppose in a house or hall with a peaked roof, opposite a window facing east, the sun was rising. When its rays enter through the window, where would they settle?"

"On the western wall, venerable sir."

"So too, bhikkhus, the brahmin Uṇṇabha has gained faith in the Tathāgata that is settled, deeply rooted, established, firm. It cannot be removed by any ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māra or Brahma or by anyone in the world. If, bhikkhus, the brahmin Uṇṇabha were to die at this time, there is no fetter bound by which he might again come to this world."


## SN35:23 The All
What's the "all"?

At Sāvatthī. "Bhikkhus, I will teach you the all.
 Listen to that … .

"And what, bhikkhus, is the all? The eye and forms, the ear and sounds, the nose and odours, the tongue and tastes, the body and tactile objects, the mind and mental phenomena. This is called the all.

"If anyone, bhikkhus, should speak thus: ‘Having rejected this all, I shall make known another all’—that would be a mere empty boast on his part. If he were questioned he would not be able to reply and, further, he would meet with vexation. For what reason? Because, bhikkhus, that would not be within his domain."

## SN35:93 The Dyad (2)

"Bhikkhus, consciousness comes to be in dependence on a dyad. And how, bhikkhus, does consciousness come to be in dependence on a dyad? In dependence on the eye and forms there arises eye-consciousness. The eye is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise; forms are impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. Thus this dyad is moving and tottering, impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise.

"Eye-consciousness is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. The cause and condition for the arising of eye-consciousness is also impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. When, bhikkhus, eye-consciousness has arisen in dependence on a condition that is impermanent, how could it be permanent?

"The meeting, the encounter, the concurrence of these three things is called eye-contact. Eye-contact too is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. The cause and condition for the arising of eye-contact is also impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. When, bhikkhus, eye-contact has arisen in dependence on a condition that is impermanent, how could it be permanent?

"Contacted, bhikkhus, one feels, contacted one intends, contacted one perceives. Thus these things too are moving and tottering, impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise.

"In dependence on the ear and sounds there arises ear-consciousness … … In dependence on the mind and mental phenomena there arises mind-consciousness. The mind is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise; mental phenomena are impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. Thus this dyad is moving and tottering, impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise.

"Mind-consciousness is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. The cause and condition for the arising of mind-consciousness is also impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. When, bhikkhus, mind-consciousness has arisen in dependence on a condition that is impermanent, how could it be permanent?

"The meeting, the encounter, the concurrence of these three things is called mind-contact. Mind-contact too is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. The cause and condition for the arising of mind-contact is also impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. When, bhikkhus, mind-contact has arisen in dependence on a condition that is impermanent, how could it be permanent?

"Contacted, bhikkhus, one feels, contacted one intends, contacted one perceives. Thus these things too are moving and tottering, impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise.

"It is in such a way, bhikkhus, that consciousness comes to be in dependence on a dyad."


## SN35:28 Burning
Everything's on fire!

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Gaya, at Gaya's Head, together with a thousand bhikkhus. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:

"Bhikkhus, all is burning. And what, bhikkhus, is the all that is burning? The eye is burning, forms are burning, eye-consciousness is burning, eye-contact is burning, and whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of lust, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of delusion; burning with birth, aging, and death; with sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair, I say.

"The ear is burning … … The mind is burning … and whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of lust, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of delusion; burning with birth, aging, and death; with sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair, I say.

"Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye, towards forms, towards eye-consciousness, towards eye-contact, towards whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant; experiences revulsion towards the ear … towards the mind … towards whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … . Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion his mind is liberated. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It's liberated.’ He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’"

This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One's statement. And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of the thousand bhikkhus were liberated from the taints by nonclinging.

## MN10: Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta - The Foundations of Mindfulness (excerpt)

Contemplation of Feeling
"And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu abide contemplating feelings as feelings? Here, when feeling a pleasant feeling, a bhikkhu understands: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling’;

When feeling a painful feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a painful feeling’;

When feeling a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.’

When feeling a worldly pleasant feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a worldly pleasant feeling’;

When feeling an unworldly pleasant feeling, he understands: ‘I feel an unworldly pleasant feeling’;

When feeling a worldly painful feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a worldly painful feeling’;

When feeling an unworldly painful feeling, he understands: ‘I feel an unworldly painful feeling’;

When feeling a worldly neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a worldly neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling’;

When feeling an unworldly neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he understands: ‘I feel an unworldly neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.’

Insight
"In this way he abides contemplating feelings as feelings internally, or he abides contemplating feelings as feelings externally, or he abides contemplating feelings as feelings both internally and externally. Or else he abides contemplating in feelings their nature of arising, or he abides contemplating in feelings their nature of vanishing, or he abides contemplating in feelings their nature of both arising and vanishing. Or else mindfulness that ‘there is feeling’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness. And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating feelings as feelings.

"Friend Visākha, there are three kinds of feeling: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling."

"But, lady, what is pleasant feeling? What is painful feeling? What is neither painful-nor-pleasant feeling?"

"Friend Visākha, whatever is felt bodily or mentally as pleasant and soothing is pleasant feeling. Whatever is felt bodily or mentally as painful and hurting is painful feeling. Whatever is felt bodily or mentally as neither soothing nor hurting is neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling."

"Lady, what is pleasant and what is painful in regard to pleasant feeling? What is painful and what is pleasant in regard to painful feeling? What is pleasant and what is painful in regard to neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling?"

"Friend Visākha, pleasant feeling is pleasant when it persists and painful when it changes. Painful feeling is painful when it persists and pleasant when it changes. Neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling is pleasant when there is knowledge of it and painful when there is no knowledge of it."

Underlying Tendencies
"Lady, what underlying tendency underlies pleasant feeling? What underlying tendency underlies painful feeling? What underlying tendency underlies neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling?"

"Friend Visākha, the underlying tendency to lust underlies pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency to aversion underlies painful feeling. The underlying tendency to ignorance underlies neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling."

"Lady, does the underlying tendency to lust underlie all pleasant feeling? Does the underlying tendency to aversion underlie all painful feeling? Does the underlying tendency to ignorance underlie all neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling?"

"Friend Visākha, the underlying tendency to lust does not underlie all pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency to aversion does not underlie all painful feeling. The underlying tendency to ignorance does not underlie all neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling."

"Lady, what should be abandoned in regard to pleasant feeling? What should be abandoned in regard to painful feeling? What should be abandoned in regard to neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling?"

"Friend Visākha, the underlying tendency to lust should be abandoned in regard to pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency to aversion should be abandoned in regard to painful feeling. The underlying tendency to ignorance should be abandoned in regard to neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling."

"Lady, does the underlying tendency to lust have to be abandoned in regard to all pleasant feeling? Does the underlying tendency to aversion have to be abandoned in regard to all painful feeling? Does the underlying tendency to ignorance have to be abandoned in regard to all neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling?"

"Friend Visākha, the underlying tendency to lust does not have to be abandoned in regard to all pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency to aversion does not have to be abandoned in regard to all painful feeling. The underlying tendency to ignorance does not have to be abandoned in regard to all neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.

"Here, friend Visākha, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. With that he abandons lust, and the underlying tendency to lust does not underlie that.

Grief arises with that longing as condition. With that he abandons aversion, and the underlying tendency to aversion does not underlie that.

"Here, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhāna, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. With that he abandons ignorance, and the underlying tendency to ignorance does not underlie that."

Counterparts
"Lady, what is the counterpart of pleasant feeling?"

"Friend Visākha, painful feeling is the counterpart of pleasant feeling."

"What is the counterpart of painful feeling?"

"Pleasant feeling is the counterpart of painful feeling."

"What is the counterpart of neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling?"

"Ignorance is the counterpart of neither-painful-nor pleasant feeling."

"What is the counterpart of ignorance?"

"True knowledge is the counterpart of ignorance."

"What is the counterpart of true knowledge?"

"Deliverance is the counterpart of true knowledge."

"What is the counterpart of deliverance?"

"Nibbāna is the counterpart of deliverance."

"Lady, what is the counterpart of Nibbāna?"

"Friend Visākha, you have pushed this line of questioning too far; you were not able to grasp the limit to questions. For the holy life, friend Visākha, is grounded upon Nibbāna, culminates in Nibbāna, ends in Nibbāna. If you wish, friend Visākha, go to the Blessed One and ask him about the meaning of this. As the Blessed One explains it to you, so you should remember it."

## SN36:3 Abandonment
On the underlying rendencies

"Bhikkhus, there are these three feelings. What three? Pleasant feeling, painful feeling, neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency to lust should be abandoned in regard to pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency to aversion should be abandoned in regard to painful feeling. The underlying tendency to ignorance should be abandoned in regard to neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.

"When, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has abandoned the underlying tendency to lust in regard to pleasant feeling, the underlying tendency to aversion in regard to painful feeling, and the underlying tendency to ignorance in regard to neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, then he is called a bhikkhu without underlying tendencies, one who sees rightly. He has cut off craving, severed the fetters, and by completely breaking through conceit, he has made an end to suffering."

When one experiences pleasure,
If one does not understand feeling
The tendency to lust is present
For one not seeing the escape from it.

When one experiences pain,
If one does not understand feeling
The tendency to aversion is present
For one not seeing the escape from it.

The One of Broad Wisdom has taught
With reference to that peaceful feeling,
Neither-painful-nor-pleasant:
If one seeks delight even in this,
One is still not released from suffering.

But when a bhikkhu who is ardent
Does not neglect clear comprehension,
Then that wise man fully understands
Feelings in their entirety.

Having fully understood feelings,
He is taintless in this very life.
Standing in Dhamma, with the body's breakup
The knowledge-master cannot be reckoned.

## SN36:5 Should Be Seen
On how vedanā should be understood.

"Bhikkhus, there are these three feelings. What three? Pleasant feeling, painful feeling, neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Pleasant feeling, bhikkhus, should be seen as painful; painful feeling should be seen as a dart; neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling should be seen as impermanent.

"When, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has seen pleasant feeling as painful, painful feeling as a dart, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling as impermanent, he is called a bhikkhu who sees rightly. He has cut off craving, severed the fetters, and by completely breaking through conceit, he has made an end to suffering."

One who has seen the pleasant as painful
And the painful as a dart,
Seen as impermanent the peaceful feeling
Neither painful nor pleasant:

He is a bhikkhu who sees rightly,
One who fully understands feelings.
Having fully understood feelings,
He is taintless in this very life.
Standing in Dhamma, with the body's breakup
The knowledge-master cannot be reckoned.


## SN36:6 The Dart
On the two darts, physical and mental suffering.

"Bhikkhus, the uninstructed worldling feels a pleasant feeling, a painful feeling, and a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. The instructed noble disciple too feels a pleasant feeling, a painful feeling, and a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Therein, bhikkhus, what is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling?"

"Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, take recourse in the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will remember it."

"Then listen and attend closely, bhikkhus, I will speak."

"Yes, venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, when the uninstructed worldling is being contacted by a painful feeling, he sorrows, grieves, and laments; he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught. He feels two feelings—a bodily one and a mental one. Suppose they were to strike a man with a dart, and then they would strike him immediately afterwards with a second dart, so that the man would feel a feeling caused by two darts. So too, when the uninstructed worldling is being contacted by a painful feeling … he feels two feelings—a bodily one and a mental one.

"Being contacted by that same painful feeling, he harbours aversion towards it. When he harbours aversion towards painful feeling, the underlying tendency to aversion towards painful feeling lies behind this. Being contacted by painful feeling, he seeks delight in sensual pleasure. For what reason? Because the uninstructed worldling does not know of any escape from painful feeling other than sensual pleasure. When he seeks delight in sensual pleasure, the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling lies behind this. He does not understand as it really is the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of these feelings. When he does not understand these things, the underlying tendency to ignorance in regard to neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling lies behind this.

"If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it attached. If he feels a painful feeling, he feels it attached. If he feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he feels it attached. This, bhikkhus, is called an uninstructed worldling who is attached to birth, aging, and death; who is attached to sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; who is attached to suffering, I say.

"Bhikkhus, when the instructed noble disciple is contacted by a painful feeling, he does not sorrow, grieve, or lament; he does not weep beating his breast and become distraught. He feels one feeling—a bodily one, not a mental one.

Suppose they were to strike a man with a dart, but they would not strike him immediately afterwards with a second dart, so that the man would feel a feeling caused by one dart only. So too, when the instructed noble disciple is contacted by a painful feeling … he feels one feeling—a bodily one, not a mental one.

"Being contacted by that same painful feeling, he harbours no aversion towards it. Since he harbours no aversion towards painful feeling, the underlying tendency to aversion towards painful feeling does not lie behind this. Being contacted by painful feeling, he does not seek delight in sensual pleasure. For what reason? Because the instructed noble disciple knows of an escape from painful feeling other than sensual pleasure. Since he does not seek delight in sensual pleasure, the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling does not lie behind this. He understands as it really is the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of these feelings. Since he understands these things, the underlying tendency to ignorance in regard to neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling does not lie behind this.

"If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it detached. If he feels a painful feeling, he feels it detached. If he feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he feels it detached. This, bhikkhus, is called a noble disciple who is detached from birth, aging, and death; who is detached from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; who is detached from suffering, I say.

"This, bhikkhus, is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling."

The wise one, learned, does not feel
The pleasant and painful mental feeling.
This is the great difference between
The wise one and the worldling.

For the learned one who has comprehended Dhamma,
Who clearly sees this world and the next,
Desirable things do not provoke his mind,
Towards the undesired he has no aversion.

For him attraction and repulsion no more exist;
Both have been extinguished, brought to an end.
Having known the dust-free, sorrowless state,
The transcender of existence rightly understands.





## MN152: Indriyabhāvanāsutta - The Development of the Faculties
On developing equanimity to sense experience.

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Kajangalā in a grove of mukhelu trees.

Then the brahmin student Uttarā, a pupil of the brahmin Pārāsariya, went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side. The Blessed One then asked him: "Uttarā, does the brahmin Pārāsariya teach his disciples the development of the faculties?"

"He does, Master Gotama."

"But, Uttarā, how does he teach his disciples the development of the faculties?"

"Here, Master Gotama, one does not see forms with the eye, one does not hear sounds with the ear. That is how the brahmin Pārāsariya teaches his disciples the development of the faculties."

"If that is so, Uttarā, then a blind man and a deaf man will have developed faculties, according to what the brahmin Pārāsariya says. For a blind man does not see forms with the eye, and a deaf man does not hear sounds with the ear."

When this was said, the brahmin student Uttarā, Pārāsariya's pupil, sat silent, dismayed, with shoulders drooping and head down, glum, and without response.

Then, knowing this, the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ānanda: "Ānanda, the brahmin Pārāsariya teaches his disciples the development of the faculties in one way, but in the Noble One's Discipline the supreme development of the faculties is otherwise."

"Now is the time, Blessed One, now is the time, Sublime One, for the Blessed One to teach the supreme development of the faculties in the Noble One's Discipline. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it."

"Then listen, Ānanda, and attend closely to what I shall say."

"Yes, venerable sir," he replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Now, Ānanda, how is there the supreme development of the faculties in the Noble One's Discipline? Here, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu sees a form with the eye, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He understands thus: ‘There has arisen in me what is agreeable, there has arisen what is disagreeable, there has arisen what is both agreeable and disagreeable. But that is conditioned, gross, dependently arisen; this is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, equanimity.’ The agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease in him and equanimity is established. Just as a man with good sight, having opened his eyes might shut them or having shut his eyes might open them, so too concerning anything at all, the agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly, just as rapidly, just as easily, and equanimity is established. This is called in the Noble One's Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding forms cognizable by the eye.

"Again, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu hears a sound with the ear, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He understands thus: … and equanimity is established. Just as a strong man might easily snap his fingers, so too concerning anything at all, the agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly, just as rapidly, just as easily, and equanimity is established. This is called in the Noble One's Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding sounds cognizable by the ear.

"Again, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu smells an odour with the nose, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He understands thus: … and equanimity is established. Just as raindrops on a slightly sloping lotus leaf roll off and do not remain there, so too concerning anything at all, the agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly, just as rapidly, just as easily, and equanimity is established. This is called in the Noble One's Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding odours cognizable by the nose.

"Again, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu tastes a flavour with the tongue, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He understands thus: … and equanimity is established. Just as a strong man might easily spit out a ball of spittle collected on the tip of his tongue, so too concerning anything at all, the agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly, just as rapidly, just as easily, and equanimity is established. This is called in the Noble One's Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding flavours cognizable by the tongue.

"Again, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu touches a tangible with the body, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He understands thus: … and equanimity is established. Just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, so too concerning anything at all, the agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly, just as rapidly, just as easily, and equanimity is established. This is called in the Noble One's Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding tangibles cognizable by the body.

"Again, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu cognizes a mind-object with the mind, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He understands thus: … and equanimity is established. Just as if a man were to let two or three drops of water fall onto an iron plate heated for a whole day, the falling of the drops might be slow but they would quickly vaporise and vanish, so too concerning anything at all, the agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly, just as rapidly, just as easily, and equanimity is established. This is called in the Noble One's Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding ideas cognizable by the mind.

"That is how there is the supreme development of the faculties in the Noble One's Discipline.

"And how, Ānanda, is one a disciple in higher training, one who has entered upon the way? Here, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu sees a form with the eye … hears a sound with the ear … smells an odour with the nose … tastes a flavour with the tongue … touches a tangible with the body … cognizes a mind-object with the mind, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable; he is repelled, humiliated, and disgusted by the agreeable that arose, by the disagreeable that arose, and by the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose. That is how one is a disciple in higher training, one who has entered upon the way.

–11"And how, Ānanda, is one a noble one with developed faculties? Here, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu sees a form with the eye … hears a sound with the ear … smells an odour with the nose … tastes a flavour with the tongue … touches a tangible with the body … cognizes a mind-object with the mind, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. If he should wish: ‘May I abide perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,’ he abides perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive. If he should wish: ‘May I abide perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive, ’ he abides perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive. If he should wish: ‘May I abide perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ he abides perceiving the unrepulsive in that. If he should wish: ‘May I abide perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,’ he abides perceiving the repulsive in that. If he should wish: ‘May I, avoiding both the repulsive and unrepulsive, abide in equanimity, mindful and fully aware,’ he abides in equanimity towards that, mindful and fully aware.
 That is how one is a noble one with developed faculties.

"So, Ānanda, the supreme development of the faculties in the Noble One's Discipline has been taught by me, the disciple in higher training who has entered upon the way has been taught by me, and the noble one with developed faculties has been taught by me.

"What should be done for his disciples out of compassion by a Teacher who seeks their welfare and has compassion for them, that I have done for you, Ānanda. There are these roots of trees, these empty huts. Meditate, Ānanda, do not delay, or else you will regret it later. This is our instruction to you."

That is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ānanda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.

## MN123: Acchariyaabbhutasutta - Incredible and Amazing (excerpt)

"That being so, Ānanda, remember this too as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Tathāgata: Here, Ānanda, for the Tathāgata feelings are known as they arise, as they are present, as they disappear; perceptions are known as they arise, as they are present, as they disappear; thoughts are known as they arise, as they are present, as they disappear. Remember this too, Ānanda, as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Tathāgata."

"Venerable sir, since for the Blessed One feelings are known as they arise, as they are present, as they disappear; perceptions are known as they arise, as they are present, as they disappear; thoughts are known as they arise, as they are present, as they disappear — this too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One."

That is what the venerable Ānanda said. The Teacher approved. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the venerable Ānanda's words.

# 5.04 Suttas on Emptiness

## SN35:85 Empty Is the World
On emptiness.

Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One … and said to him: "Venerable sir, it is said, ‘Empty is the world, empty is the world.’ In what way, venerable sir, is it said, ‘Empty is the world’?"

"It is, Ānanda, because it is empty of self and of what belongs to self that it is said, ‘Empty is the world.’ And what is empty of self and of what belongs to self? The eye, Ānanda, is empty of self and of what belongs to self. Forms are empty of self and of what belongs to self. Eye-consciousness is empty of self and of what belongs to self. Eye-contact is empty of self and of what belongs to self … . Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is empty of self and of what belongs to self.

"It is, Ānanda, because it is empty of self and of what belongs to self that it is said, ‘Empty is the world.’"

## Sutta Nipāta 5:16 The Questions of Mogharājā
Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato

 “Twice I have asked the Sakyan,”
said Venerable Mogharājā,
“but you haven’t answered me, O Seer.
I have heard that the divine hermit
answers when questioned a third time.

 Regarding this world, the other world,
and the realm of Brahmā with its gods,
I’m not familiar with the view
of the renowned Gotama.

 So I have come seeking with a question
for the one of excellent vision.
How to look upon the world
so the King of Death won’t see you?”

 “Look upon the world as empty,
Mogharājā, ever mindful.
Having uprooted the view of self,
you may thus cross over death.
That’s how to look upon the world
so the King of Death won’t see you.”

The Young Man Mogharāja's Questions are Finished

## Dhammapada - Chapter 20: Maggavagga - The Path (excerpt)
Translated from the Pali by Acharya Buddharakkhita.

"All conditioned things are impermanent"—when one sees this with wisdom, one turns away from suffering. This is the path to purification.

"All conditioned things are unsatisfactory"—when one sees this with wisdom, one turns away from suffering. This is the path to purification.

"All things are not-self"—when one sees this with wisdom, one turns away from suffering. This is the path to purification.
