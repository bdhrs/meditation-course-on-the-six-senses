There are some powerful benefits to maintaining continuous awareness of *anatta* discussed in Aṅguttara Nikāya:

> *"cha, bhikkhave, ānisaṃse sampassamānena alameva bhikkhunā sabbadhammesu anodhiṃ karitvā anattasaññaṃ upaṭṭhāpetuṃ. katame cha? sabbaloke ca atammayo bhavissāmi, ahaṅkārā ca me uparujjhissanti, mamaṅkārā ca me uparujjhissanti, asādhāraṇena ca ñāṇena samannāgato bhavissāmi, hetu ca me sudiṭṭho bhavissati, hetusamuppannā ca dhammā. ime kho, bhikkhave, cha ānisaṃse sampassamānena alameva bhikkhunā sabbadhammesu anodhiṃ karitvā anattasaññaṃ upaṭṭhāpetu"nti.*
> 
> Monks, seeing six benefits, it is suitable for a monastic to establish the perception of *anatta* in all conditioned things, without exception.
> 
> What six?
> 
> 1. I will not identify with the entire world
> 2. I-makings will cease for me
> 3. My-makings will cease for me
> 4. I will possess uncommon understanding
> 5. Causes will be clearly seen
> 6. Causally originated phenomena will be clearly seen
> 
> -- *AN6.104 atammayasuttaṃ*

## An Interrogation

One of the most common *anatta* meditation methods prescribed in the suttas—occurring in more than 75 suttas—is this line of enquiry. It consists of three questions:

What do you think, is this *nicca* or *anicca*?

Whatever is *anicca*, is that *dukkha* or *sukha*?

And whatever is *dukkha*, changing in nature, is it suitable to regard that as, 'this is mine, this is me, this is my self'?

One of the most famous instances of this method is the sutta in which the Buddha prescribed it to his own son, Rāhula, which lead directly to him becoming an arahant.

> *"taṃ kiṃ maññasi, rāhula, cakkhu niccaṃ vā aniccaṃ vā"ti? "aniccaṃ, bhante ". "yaṃ panāniccaṃ dukkhaṃ vā taṃ sukhaṃ vā"ti? "dukkhaṃ, bhante". "yaṃ panāniccaṃ dukkhaṃ vipariṇāmadhammaṃ, kallaṃ nu taṃ samanupassituṃ – ‘etaṃ mama, esohamasmi, eso me attā"’ti? "no hetaṃ, bhante".*
> 
> What do you think, Rāhula, is the eye *nicca* or *anicca*?
> 
> *Anicca*, bhante.
> 
> And whatever is *anicca*, is that *dukkha* or *sukha*?
> 
> *Dukkha*, bhante.
> 
> And whatever is *dukkha*, changing in nature, is it suitable to regard that as, 'this is mine, this is me, this is my self'?
> 
> Certainly not, bhante.
> 
> -- *MN147 cūḷarāhulovādasuttaṃ* 

The sutta continues in this way for all components of experience, the experiences themselves, and all *vedanā*, *saññā*, *saṅkhārā* and *viññāṇa* which arise from the experience.

What this sutta directly shows is how *experience creates the sense of self*, not the other way around. 

So let's go through it in a very practical way.
