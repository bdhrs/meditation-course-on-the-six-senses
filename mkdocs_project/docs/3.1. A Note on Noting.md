Noting is purposefully generated inner dialogue for the purpose of focusing attention.

If you find that you're mind-wandering aimlessly or have unskilful inner dialogue, noting is certainly better than that. 

But if you find that your awareness is steady and continuous, then just *knowing* experience is much objectively better, faster and more accurate than noting.

Think of noting like training wheels on a bicycle—they are useful when you're unsteady on two wheels. But once you are able to balance by yourself, they are just going to slow you down. 

Each time you note something, you're effectively creating a mental experience which conceals whatever else is happening, momentarily blinding awareness—like a post-it note covers the object it is pasted on.

At a certain point of practice, any inner dialogue is an obstacle to progress, so please use noting judiciously when necessary, and stop noting as soon as it's not needed.
