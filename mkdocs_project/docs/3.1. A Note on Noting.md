Noting is purposefully generated inner dialogue for the purpose of focusing attention.

If you find that you're mind-wandering aimlessly or have unskilful inner dialogue, noting is certainly better than that.

But if you find that your awareness is steady and continuous, then just *knowing* experience is much objectively better, faster and more accurate than noting.

Think of noting like training wheels on a bicycle—they are useful when you're unsteady on two wheels. But once you are able to balance by yourself, they are just going to slow you down.

Each time you note something, you're effectively creating a mental experience which conceals whatever else is happening, momentarily blinding awareness—like a post-it note covers the object it is pasted on.

At a certain point of practice, any inner dialogue is an obstacle to progress, so please use noting judiciously when necessary, and stop noting as soon as it's not needed.

## Meditation on 'this'

We're going to use a simple word, 'this' to understand the difference between noting and plain knowing. You can use any language you like—the Pāḷi is *idaṃ*, as in *idaṃ dukkhaṃ*, 'this is *dukkha*'.

The meditation on 'this' is an exercise in open awareness. Just be aware of naturally occurring experiences.

All that you're going to add to these naturally occurring experiences is a note, a label, 'this'.

With each new experience, simply note it as 'this', mentally label it 'this'.

The purpose of noting 'this' is merely a tool to keep bringing attention back to experience, after experience, after experience.

'This' simple refers to 'this' experience which is happening right now.

'This' experience.

'This' new experience.

'This' sight.

'This' sound.

'This' smell.

'This' taste.

'This' feeling in the body.

'This' thought.

Note them all as 'this'.

That experience has gone, now there is 'this.'

Keep noting 'this' with every new experience.

---
'This' is merely an arrow pointing the mind at 'this' thing which is happening right now.

With each experience, with each new experience, with each new type of experience, note it as 'this'.

You can label everything as 'this'.

---
'This'.

'This'.

'This'.

---
'This' sight.

'This' sound.

'This' smell.

'This' taste.

'This' feeling in the body.

'This' thought.

---
Now we're going to make one small change to the meditation. Instead of *noting* 'this' experience verbally in the mind, just silently *know* this experience.

Exactly the same as before, just without the note, without the label. Not noting experiences, simply knowing experiences. 

---
Knowing *this* sight.

Knowing *this* sound.

Knowing *this* smell.

Knowing *this* taste.

Knowing *this* physical sensation.

Knowing *this* mental phenomenon.

Smooth silent knowing.

Knowing this.

---
Knowing *this* experience.

Knowing *this* experience.

Knowing *this* experience.

---
Noting is helpful in the beginning, but silently knowing is more powerful.

Carry on in this way.

Knowing *this*.

Knowing *this*.

Knowing *this*.

---
Knowing *this* sight.

Knowing *this* sound.

Knowing *this* smell.

Knowing *this* taste.

Knowing *this* physical sensation.

Knowing *this* mental phenomenon.

---
When you need help, note 'this'.

If not, just know *this*.

And *this* and *this* and *this*.
