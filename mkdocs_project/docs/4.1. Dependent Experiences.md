Starting from a firm foundation of mindfulness of sense experience, next we are going to examine the dependent nature of sense experience.

There's an excellent sutta on the topic, Majjhima Nikāya 148 is called the Chachakkasuttaṃ, which means the Discourse on the Six Groups of Six.

This one paragraph in that sutta briefly outlines the remainder of this course. I translate very literally, and we then we can unpack the implications afterwards.
 
> *cha ajjhattikāni āyatanāni veditabbāni, cha bāhirāni āyatanāni veditabbāni, cha viññāṇakāyā veditabbā, cha phassakāyā veditabbā, cha vedanākāyā veditabbā, cha taṇhākāyā veditabbā.* 
> 
> The six internal fields should be known, the six external fields should be known, the six classes of consciousness should be known, the six classes of contact should be known, the six classes of *vedanā* should be known, and the six classes of craving should be known.
> 
> -- *MN148 chachakkasuttaṃ*

The sutta then goes on to define each group of six.

So what we have here, in the terse language of Pāḷi discourses, is a discussion about the dependency of every experience. Let's explore this in more detail.
