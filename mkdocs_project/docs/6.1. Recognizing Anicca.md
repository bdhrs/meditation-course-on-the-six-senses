Everything that is constructed and conditioned has come into being at some point, and, when the conditions for its existence no longer exist, will stop being. 

Even things as seemingly permanent as the sun and the earth did not always exist, they came into being when the conditions assembled, and will cease to exist when those conditions no longer hold. 

But even with these cosmic examples, with their incredibly long lasting nature, are only known to use through brief, fleeting experiences. That's all we ever have of them. The same goes for everything which we assume persists for years and decades, but all we ever have of them is an accumulation of temporary moments. 

When all we have of anything, in reality, is a few fleeting moments of experience, it seems ridiculous to rely on them, take them as a stable foundation, expect any permanent gratification out of them, base our hopes, dreams, expectations and future happiness on them. Everything constructed and conditioned is extremely unreliable in this regard. 

But, of course we forget this all the time, even when we know it in theory. So, it's a wholesome and practical exercise to frequently remind ourselves of this basic fact existence—the impermanence, fragility and instability of everything that we experience.
