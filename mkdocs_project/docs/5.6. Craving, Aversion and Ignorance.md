Finally, we come to the sixth group of six in the Chachakkasuttaṃ.

Now we come to the full picture of how conditioned sense experiences produce a response. The response mentioned here is craving, in Pāḷi, *taṇhā*, in Sanskrit, *tṛṣṇā*, literally 'thirst'. Used figuratively in this context, it represents the insatiable quality of desire. But desire is just one type of response, aversion is another, and indifference the third common response. Liking, disliking and couldn't care less.

This is neatly summed up by the awakened nun Dhammadinnā in the Majjhima Nikāya.

> *sukhāya kho, āvuso visākha, vedanāya rāgānusayo anuseti, dukkhāya vedanāya paṭighānusayo anuseti, adukkhamasukhāya vedanāya avijjānusayo anusetī'ti.* 
> 
> Comfortable *vedanā* have the underlying tendency toward desire. Uncomfortable *vedanā* have the underlying tendency toward aversion. Neither-comfortable-nor-uncomfortable *vedanā* have the underlying tendency toward ignorance.
> 
> -- *MN44 cūḷavedallasuttaṃ*

Notice that 'desire, aversion and ignorance' is just another way of saying that the habitual response to *vedanā* is greed, hatred and delusion.

We have very little control of what type of *vedanā* arises in response to any experience, mostly it is conditioned by a lifetime of previous experiences and responses. And how we respond to the *vedanā* is even more automatic. We will almost always respond to pleasantness with want and desire. We will almost always respond to unpleasantness with aversion and repulsion. And we will almost always respond to neutral *vedanā* with indifference, simply ignoring what is occurring, effectively not knowing and not understanding what is happening. That is the definition of ignorance.

We may think we are autonomous human beings with free will and the choice to respond to life's experiences as we wish, but mostly we are puppets of *vedanā*. The push and pull of these subtle feelings in the mind exert the most powerful control over our entire existence. This is some very deep programming that cannot be overcome with mere theoretical understanding or wishful thinking.

In order to get rid of craving, aversion and ignorance, first we have to see them actually occurring within experience.

Luckily desire is not some abstract term, but something tangible within our own experience. In fact, the Buddha even used it as the definition of something "visible here and now".

> *atha kho āyasmā upavāṇo yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami…pe… ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā upavāṇo bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – "‘sandiṭṭhiko dhammo, sandiṭṭhiko dhammo’ti, bhante, vuccati. kittāvatā nu kho, bhante, sandiṭṭhiko dhammo hoti, akāliko ehipassiko opaneyyiko paccattaṃ veditabbo viññūhī"ti?*

If we are able to see craving, aversion and ignorance in response to *vedanā*, we will be able to understand more about ourselves than any psychologist can ever tell us. It's worth a century of analysis, or decades of plant based psychedelic experiences. From this, it is possible to truly understand the Buddha's epithet of being the *mahābhisakka*, the Great Healer. It's no exaggeration to say that actually seeing subtle *rāga*, *dosa* and *moha* within our own minds can transform our entire relationship with the world.

In order to bring this subtle aspect of experience to our attention, we must learn to recognise types of behaviour that are typical of craving. It can be seen indirectly in any compulsive behaviours. Underneath the action, there's a desire for something, otherwise we wouldn't perform the action. Likewise, ill will can be seen indirectly in the mind whenever we find ourselves mentally explaining to someone why they are wrong, and (of course) we are right. Ignorance can be seen indirectly whenever mind wandering and day dreaming is concurring, watching fictional soap operas in the mind.

Greed, hatred and delusion are called *akusalmūla*, the unwholesome roots of intentional action by mind, speech and body. Anything that we think, say, or do while they are present in the mind is *akusala* with *akusala* results. When not present, everything we think, say, or do is *kusala* with *kusala* results.

> *sabbapāpassa akaraṇaṃ, kusalassa upasampadā,*
> *sacittapariyodapanaṃ , etaṃ buddhāna sāsanaṃ.*
> 
> Not doing any wrong,
> undertaking what is skilful,
> cleaning one's own mind,
> this is the instruction of Buddha's
> 
> -- *DHP14 Dhammapada, Buddhavagga, verse 183*

This *sacittapariyodapanaṃ*, the process of cleaning our minds, can only begin when we actually can see the dirt in our minds. It's like trying to sweep a room clean when it is pitch black dark. Sure, we can move a bit of dust around, but it's a a hit-and-miss job. Only when we actually see the dirt—see the cobwebs, see the dust bunnies running around—can we properly remove them.

In terms of progress along the path, a stream enterer still has a full complement of defilements, just not so strong as to take one to hell. A once-returner has further reduced greed and hatred. An *anāgāmī* is has finished the process of cleaning craving and aversion from their minds. An arahant has completely removed all traces of ignorance as well.

Craving, aversion and ignorance are not abstract concepts which need to be understood in theory, but very real, ever-present mental qualities that must be recognized within the mind, seen in real-time, before there is any hope of removing them or escape from them. 

So let's look for these things within our own minds. Working systematically, we will go through the fields of the eye, the ear, the body and the mind, knowing each experience, knowing the *vedanā*, then watching to see how the mind responds to that *vedanā*. 

---
Open your eyes if they are closed, and give your full attention to whatever you are seeing. 

With each experience of seeing, there is an associated *vedanā*.

Recognise which type of *vedanā* is occurring in response to the experience, either pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. 

Watch carefully, right there, how your mind is responding to *vedanā*.

The habitual response to pleasant *vedanā* is attraction, there is the tendency towards liking, being happy with, wanting more, desiring, craving, attaching, loving what's happening. 

Watch carefully, right there, how your mind is responding to *vedanā*.

The habitual response to unpleasant *vedanā* is repulsion, there is the tendency towards pushing away, resistance, aversion, not wanting, disliking, hating what's happening.

Watch carefully, right there, how your mind is responding to *vedanā*.

The habitual response to neutral *vedanā* is to ignore, there is the tendency towards being indifferent, being disinterested, passing over, not knowing, not wanting to know, being unaware, not giving any importance, non-comprehension of what's happening. 

Watch carefully, right there, how your mind is responding to *vedanā*.

Right now, it's enough merely to recognise the pull towards the pleasant, the push away from the unpleasant, and ignoring the neutral. 

Keep working like this: 

1. following experience
2. recognising the *vedanā*
3. watching the habitual response to *vedanā*. 

---
Close your eyes, open your ears, and give your full attention to whatever you are hearing. 

With each experience of hearing sounds, there is an associated *vedanā*.

Recognise which type of *vedanā* is occurring in response to hearing, either pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. 

Watch carefully, right there, how your mind is responding to *vedanā*.

The habitual response to pleasant *vedanā* is attraction, there is the tendency towards liking, being happy with, wanting more, desiring, craving, attaching, loving what's happening.

The habitual response to neutral *vedanā* is to ignore, there is the tendency towards being indifferent, being disinterested, passing over, not knowing, not wanting to know, being unaware, not giving any importance, non-comprehension of what's happening. 

Watch carefully, right there, how your mind is responding to *vedanā*.

Keep working like this: 

1. following experience
2. recognising the *vedanā*
3. watching the habitual response to *vedanā*. 

These responses to *vedanā* are so subtle, so deeply ingrained, and yet so common, that it makes them difficult to see, unless you pay careful attention.
