The solution the Buddha proposed is not to solve all the material problems of the world and seek physical immortality. The solution he proposed lies in a different direction entirely. Understanding structural nature *dukkha*, what else can one do than stop holding onto things which can only provide *dukkha*. This is a mental solution, not a physical one. 

So it's good to remind ourselves, as frequently as possible, about the inherent nature of *dukkha*, that all experience—and components of experience—are *dukkha* due to their unstable nature. Understanding that they are *dukkha*, we are free to give up our interest and desire right there. 

> *"yaṃ kho, rādha, dukkhaṃ tatra te chando pahātabbo.*
> 
> Rādha, whatever is *dukkha*, right there, the interest in it should be abandoned.
> 
> -- *SN35.77 rādhadukkhasuttaṃ*

There are some benefits to this practice discussed in Aṅguttara Nikāya:

> *"cha, bhikkhave, ānisaṃse sampassamānena alameva bhikkhunā sabbasaṅkhāresu anodhiṃ karitvā dukkhasaññaṃ upaṭṭhāpetuṃ. katame cha? ‘sabbasaṅkhāresu ca me nibbidasaññā paccupaṭṭhitā bhavissati, seyyathāpi ukkhittāsike vadhake. sabbalokā ca me mano vuṭṭhahissati, nibbāne ca santadassāvī bhavissāmi, anusayā ca me samugghātaṃ gacchissanti , kiccakārī ca bhavissāmi, satthā ca me pariciṇṇo bhavissati mettāvatāyā’ti.*
> 
> Monks, seeing six benefits, it is suitable for a monastic to establish the perception of *dukkha* in all conditioned things, without exception.
> 
> What six?
> 
> 1. The perception of disenchantment in regard to all conditioned things will be established in me, like a murdered with a raised sword.
> 2. My mind will rise above the entire world. 
> 3. I will perceive *nibbāna* as peace.
> 4. The underlying tendencies will be eradicated.
> 5. I will be doing what should be done.
> 6. I will have served the teacher with with kindness. 
> 
> -- *AN6.103 ukkhittāsikasuttaṃ*

Through seeing this inherent nature of *dukkha* in every conditioned thing, we give up the interest in and desire for it, as echoed in the famous Dhammapada verse:

> *"sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā"ti, yadā paññāya passati,*
> *atha nibbindati dukkhe, esa maggo visuddhiyā.*
> 
> Everything fabricated is *dukkha*,
> When one sees this with understanding,
> Then one gets disenchanted by suffering,
> This is the path to purification.
> 
> -- *DHP20 Dhammpada, maggavagga, verse 278*

With that, let's practice.
