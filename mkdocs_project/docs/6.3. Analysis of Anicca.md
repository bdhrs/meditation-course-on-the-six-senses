There are some well documented benefits to cultivating *aniccasaññā*, the perception of impermanence, mentioned in the Aṅguttara Nikāya. 

> *"cha, bhikkhave, ānisaṃse sampassamānena alameva bhikkhunā sabbasaṅkhāresu anodhiṃ karitvā aniccasaññaṃ upaṭṭhāpetuṃ. katame cha? ‘sabbasaṅkhārā ca me anavatthitā khāyissanti, sabbaloke ca me mano nābhiramissati , sabbalokā ca me mano vuṭṭhahissati, nibbānapoṇañca me mānasaṃ bhavissati, saṃyojanā ca me pahānaṃ gacchissanti , paramena ca sāmaññena samannāgato bhavissāmī’ti.*

> Monks, seeing six benefits, it is suitable for a monastic to establish the perception of impermanence in all conditioned things, without exception.
> 
> What six?
> 
> 1. All conditioned things will appear unstable to me. 
> 2. My mind will take no delight in the entire world. 
> 3. My mind will rise above the entire world. 
> 4. My mentality will incline towards Nibbāna
> 5. The bonds will be abandoned
> 6. I will possess the ultimate goal of the monastic life.
