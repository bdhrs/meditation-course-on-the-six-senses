This meditation on the eighteen types of *vedanā* is an excellent exercise in open awareness and noting. 

I cannot recommend it highly enough for developing firstly, very powerful, continuous, present moment awareness, and secondly, detailed analysis and discernment of experience according to the Dhamma. 

In short, it combines *satisambojjhaṅga* and *dhammavicāyasambhojjaṅga* into a potent exercise. All you need to do is sustain the effort to reap the rewards of this practice. 

There is nothing new here, merely a new combination of things which you are already familiar with. One, naming the channel of experience, and two, naming the type of *vedanā*.

Let's go through it step by step. 

---

When seeing, immediately label the experience as *cakkhu*, eye channel or eye.

If it is a pleasant experience, label it as pleasant or *sukha*. Eye pleasant, or *cakkhu sukha*, as your prefer.

If it is an unpleasant experience, label it as *dukkha* or unpleasant. Eye unpleasant, or *cakkhu dukkha*.

If it is a neutral experience, *adukham-asukha-vedanā* is by far the most common type, label it is eye neutral, or, *cakkhu neva*.

Pay attention to your visual experiences for a while — note the channel and note the *vedanā*.
