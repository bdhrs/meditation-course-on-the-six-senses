## the fetters
Satipaṭṭhāna sutta talks about
> Know the eye, know the forms and the fetter which arises upon both

The fetters are a traditional list of ten things which bind root to the endless cycle of existence. The very first is sakkāyadiṭṭhi. This translates literally as the diṭṭhi view or belief in sat kāya, an existing body or being. It's the belief that this mind and body is I me mine, mine me I, belief in self-identity; the view that this mind-body complex is an independent entity.
