Every experience produces *vedanā*. You have seen for yourself that every experience is impermanent. Then how can *vedanā* produced by experience be permanent?

*Vedanā* changes as a new experience arises. *Vedanā* changes as an experience evolves. *Vedanā* changes as an experience ends and disappears. All *vedanā* arising from every experience rise and fall with the experience. 

This is expressed beautifully in Pāḷi as
