This meditation on the eighteen types of *vedanā* is an excellent exercise in open awareness and noting. 

I cannot recommend it highly enough for developing firstly, very powerful, continuous, present moment awareness, and secondly, detailed analysis and discernment of experience according to the Dhamma. 

In short, it combines *satisambojjhaṅga* and *dhammavicāyasambhojjaṅga* into a potent exercise. All you need to do is sustain the effort to reap the rewards of this practice. 

There is nothing new here, merely a new combination of things which you are already familiar with. One, naming the channel of experience, and two, naming the type of *vedanā*.

let us go through it step by step.
