The first dependency is on the *ajjhattikaṃ āyatanaṃ*, literally the "internal field", which we might render more understandably into English as the "sense organ" or "internal sense base". These are the body's five sense organs and the mind.

The Buddha felt it very important to understand that every experience is dependent, it doesn't stand alone without supporting conditions. The most obvious condition for any sense experience is the organ through which the experience occurs. Without an eye, there is no sight. Without a tongue, there is no such thing as taste. 

In order to really bring this home, let's do a practical exercise of seeing the dependency of every experience. The starting point, as always, will be awareness of the six sense fields, and from there we can look at the first dependency. 

The practice consists of normal sense experience plus a little bit of analysis. Some people find the analysis invigorating, some people find it tiring. If you find that the analysis is difficult or tiring, come back to simply experiencing the senses. But after a minute, push yourself to go back to analysis, and stay with it for as long as you are able. If you are able to keep analysing every experience, by all means keep going. 

Many people practising this report even stronger mindfulness than usual, because the analysis helps you to stay with the present object, and the mind has less opportunity to run away.

Most importantly, you are creating the conditions to perceive experience in a new way. 

Stay with this exercise for a few sessions. Change posture a few times, go for a walk, take something to eat or drink, maintain your awareness of experience and keep analysing the internal dependency.
