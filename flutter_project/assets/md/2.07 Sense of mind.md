"Where is my mind?" you may ask.

We live in a world of mental experience every waking moment 24/7/365. All the senses converge on the mind, are processed by the mind, perceived by the mind, responded to by the mind, and are known by the mind. Without the mind, there is quite literally no experience whatsoever.

For anyone starting with meditation on *saḷāyatana*, the mind as a sense is the most difficult thing to grasp in the beginning, difficult to perceive distinctly from the other senses. It's like we humans spend our entire life immersed in a gaseous atmosphere, without which we'd die in an instant, and yet we can say, "What air? I don't see any air. " In the same way, someone may say, "What mind? I don't see any mind. I only see trees and people and cars." But later it becomes obvious that you've only ever seen trees and people and cars in your mind. 

As one progresses with introspection, mind become the easiest sense to perceive, not only because it is ubiquitous, but because it is so fast and relentless in its activity. It is so busy gathering information from the other five sense, collating them, interpreting them, and forming responses to them, that it becomes very easy to see and follow. There is not a single moment when mental phenomena are not available to experience, except perhaps in the deepest states of sleep and coma. 

The Buddha himself remarked that his basic awareness consists of mental objects, namely feeling tone, perceptions and thoughts. 

> *tasmātiha tvaṃ, ānanda, idampi tathāgatassa acchariyaṃ abbhutadhammaṃ dhārehi. idhānanda, tathāgatassa viditā vedanā uppajjanti, viditā upaṭṭhahanti, viditā abbhatthaṃ gacchanti, viditā saññā uppajjanti, viditā upaṭṭhahanti, viditā abbhatthaṃ gacchanti, viditā vitakkā uppajjanti, viditā upaṭṭhahanti, viditā abbhatthaṃ gacchanti.*  
> 
> Therefore Ananda, you should remember this too as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Tathāgata. For him, the feeling tone of experiences are seen as they arise, persist and disappear, perceptions are seen as they arise persist and disappear, thoughts are seen as they arise persist and disappear.

Bring your attention to the mind, become aware of this field of mental experiences.

Some constructed mental activities might help you to distinctly perceive mental experience.

These are just some examples to give you an idea of the range of mental experiences. It's in no way exhaustive, in fact it's almost impossible to exhaust the range of mental experiences. But there should be enough for you to recognise mental experiences as they occur within the mental field. 

Pay attention to your mental experiences. 

Understand these are all just the mental field. 

---

Notice how the mind changes relentlessly, nothing stays still even for one second. 

Attention moves between all the senses, perceptions and thoughts arise, responses are formed, knowing is always present and shifting. 

---

Right now, the important thing is not to analyse every little phenomena that occurs in the mind, but simple to understand that this is mental activity, these are mental phenomena, these are mental processes, these are all occurring within the mental domain.

---

The important skill to develop is simply to understand when an experience is within the field of mind, to be able to clearly distinguish five sense experiences, from mental ones.

Keep coming back to this sense of mind. Give it your full attention.
