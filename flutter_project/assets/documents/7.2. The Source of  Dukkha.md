> What, sir is the source of *dukkha*? Whatever craving there is that is conducive to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and desire, namely the craving for sensual pleasures, the craving for existence, and the craving for nonexistence, this is called the source of *dukkha*.

This same idea is expressed in numerous different ways in the suttas, appealing to the character of different people. Here the source of *dukkha* is expressed as *nandī*, taking delight, taking pleasure, enjoyment. 

> *santi kho, migajāla, cakkhuviññeyyā rūpā iṭṭhā kantā manāpā piyarūpā kāmūpasaṃhitā rajanīyā. tañce bhikkhu abhinandati abhivadati ajjhosāya tiṭṭhati. tassa taṃ abhinandato abhivadato ajjhosāya tiṭṭhato uppajjati nandī. nandisamudayā dukkhasamudayo, migajālāti vadāmi*
> -- *SN35.64 dutiyamigajālasutta*

> Migajāla, there are visible forms that are pleasing, desirable, attractive, endearing, sensual and enticing. If a monk is pleased with them, welcomes them and clings to them… then delight arises. Delight, I say, is the source of *dukkha*. 

This is famously expressed in the most succinct manner in the very first sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya.

> *nandī dukkhassa mūlanti*
> -- *MN1 mūlapariyāyasutta*

> Delight is the source of *dukkha*.

This exact same idea is also expressed in terms of the six senses we are so familiar with by now. 

> *katamo ca, bhikkhave, dukkhassa samudayo? cakkhuñca paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṃ. tiṇṇaṃ saṅgati phasso. phassapaccayā vedanā, vedanāpaccayā taṇhā. ayaṃ kho, bhikkhave, dukkhassa samudayo.*

> -- *SN12.43 dukkhasuttaṃ*

> And what, monks is the source of *dukkha*. Dependent on the eye and visible forms, visual consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is a conscious experience. Dependent on conscious experience, *vedanā* arises. Dependent on *vedanā* there is craving. This is the source of *dukkha*.  
> …  
> And what, monks is the disappearance of *dukkha*. Dependent on the eye and visible forms, visual consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is a conscious experience. Dependent on conscious experience, *vedanā* arises. Dependent on *vedanā* there is craving. From the complete and utter fading and ending of that very craving, grasping ends. From the ending of grasping, becoming ends. From the ending of becoming, birth ends. From the ending of birth, old age and death ends, from the ending of old age and death, grief, wailing, pain, suffering and trouble ends. There is an ending of this entire mountain of *dukkha*. This, monks, is the disappearance of *dukkha*. 

To understand *dukkha* we need to see how it arises within experience, the exact point it begins. Understanding that our response to *vedanā* is the critical point in the chain of dependent origination, we must learn to break the chain right there.
## Meditation on the source of *dukkha*

In a very practical way, let's explore the source of *dukkha* and learn to cut it off at the root.

**intro**

Let's pay attention to whatever experience is arising right now. 

With each new experience, new *vedanā* arises. 

In response to the *vedanā*, craving can arise, aversion can arise, ignorance can arise. 

This liking and disliking, this wanting and not wanting, this desire and aversion, right here, this is the source from which all *dukkha* arises. 

Knowing that this is the source of *dukkha*, right there, remove it from the mind. 

Drop it! Abandon it! Let it go immediately! 

What remains when you remove it?

There remains a calm and balanced mind, simple observing experience. 

When the mind is alert, when the mind is calm, when the mind is non-reactive, you are cutting off *dukkha* at the very source. 

This is a delicate operation. This is a surgical operation in the mind to remove *dukkha* at the source.
