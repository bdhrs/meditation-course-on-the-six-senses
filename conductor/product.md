# Product Guide: Meditation Course on the Six Senses

## Product Vision
To provide a multi-platform, accessible, and distraction-free environment for studying and practicing the "Meditation Course on the Six Senses." The project aims to bridge the gap between digital convenience and the practical needs of serious practitioners, particularly monastics in remote areas.

## Target Audience
- **Primary:** Buddhist monastics and experienced meditators.
- **Environment:** Often remote or low-connectivity areas; users frequently rely on Android devices and limited power sources (solar).
- **Needs:** High reliability, offline functionality, and low resource consumption.

## Core Goals
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the Dhamma is available to anyone who can benefit, regardless of their technical or geographical constraints.
- **Format Diversity:** Distribute content as a web app, standalone mobile/desktop apps, EPUBs, and audio archives.
- **Offline First:** Provide a first-class experience for users with zero internet access by bundling all media within the application.
- **Continuous Delivery:** Ensure that updates to the source material (markdown/audio) are automatically propagated to all platforms without manual intervention.

## Key Features
- **Unified Content Delivery:** Seamless transition between text and audio across different platforms.
- **Bundled Media:** The mobile applications must include all course audio files to eliminate the need for subsequent downloads.
- **Automated Content Pipeline:** GitHub Workflows must handle the proliferation of content updates across all media formats (Web, App, Ebooks).
- **In-App Updater:** Mobile applications must support an internal mechanism to download and apply content updates when connectivity is available.
- **Low Power/Resource Optimization:** Design for efficiency to support extended use on solar-charged devices and older Android hardware.
- **High Readability:** A clean, typography-focused UI optimized for long-form reading.

## Brand Identity (Inferred)
- **Primary Typeface:** "Inter" (San-serif).
- **Primary Color:** Forest Green (`#366348` / `#96c5a9` in dark mode).
- **Design Language:** Minimalist, calm, and focus-oriented, using the established web color palette (Light: `#ffffff` background; Dark: `#121614` background).
