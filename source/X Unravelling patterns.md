## Breaking the chain
Over the duration of this course, we've built up a framework of concepts that the Buddha found useful for examining subjective experience. This is not only a conceptual framework, but all the important links in the chain of how, from simple sense experience, we produce greed, hatred and delusion that causes us very real suffering in our lives.

The chain might looks like this:

sense experience > *vedanā* > mental response to *vedanā* > actions by body, speech and mind > repeated action > habit patterns > suffering

The nearer to the beginning of the chain you recognize and understand this process, the easier it is to 'nip it in the bud' and break the causal chain. The nearer to the end of the chain that recognize and understand this process, the harder it is to make any effective change.

## Creating new patterns
Everything that arises in the mind is mostly just following previously created mental patterns. And how did you create those patterns? One thought at a time. To recondition the mind to perceive and think differently happens in exactly the same way. How to create new mental patterns? Response by response, thought by thought, action by action. How else to create lasting change?

Certainly, some techniques may create a temporary change, but mostly they they don't last, and eventually you slip back into old patterns of thought and behaviour.

This is a very slow and reliable method, which requires nothing more than willingness to learn and attention.

## What is your current situation
What does your current situation? As you receive input through the six senses, you respond with very strong preference and aversion to the most subtle stimuli. Even the smallest experience can completely throw you off kilter. Then you respond to people and situations inappropriately, which creates more stimulus, and so there is an ongoing cycle of being slightly off-balance all the time.

This practice presents an opportunity to know the smallest details of what you're experiencing, to have a very balanced mind in response to each and every one of those experiences, to respond calmly and appropriately, or not at all, as the case may be, as opposed to being pushed around, forced around, bullied by *vedanā* all the time.

This practice offers an opportunity to have a balanced mind and respond appropriately to normal stimulus. The net result is a decrease in suffering, a decrease in difficult situations which you've created through ill-formed responses, and an increase in pleasant life situations created by skilful responses.

## How to alter reality
What we call reality is nothing more than the subjective experience of the five senses and the mind. Apart from that, what else has anyone ever known?

The practice of returning to sense experience alters reality and reshapes the subjective world we live in for the better. The simple act of changing subjective experience changes the only reality you actually know.

The normal way most people attempt to alter reality is by changing the material world out there. That is, of course, a viable option, but outside the scope of this course.

We're going to look at three internal ways of altering reality based on an understanding of how the senses work.

1. change the object of experience
2. change the reaction to the object of experience.
3. change the understanding of the structure of experience itself 

The corollary of the mind only experiencing one thing at a time is that you can really change your life experience by simply changing what the mind rests its attention on. If you stop feeding the mind unwholesome objects, feed it more wholesome ones, and learn to sustain attention on them, you can dramatically alter your own subjective reality, and enjoy all the rewards of that.

If the object of awareness is causing you suffering, you can learn to change the object. An example is the experience of ruminating on a painful thought. Simply moving attention to the body effectively removes the thought from experience. You cannot hold a painful thought and the vivid experience of the body in the mind at the same moment. there is no need to continue letting the mind experience whatever it wants and creating unhappiness for yourself.

The second method suggested offers a deeper solution to the problem of suffering, but still not a permanent one. In many cases, it is preferable to face the reality of something painful. In those situations we cannot alter the outside world immediately, we cannot change the experience, but we can alter our *response* to the experience. This is a profound topic which will be looked at in more detail in the section on *vedanā*.

	But both of the above are temporary solutions, but the Buddha has offered a more permanent solution to the problem of suffering. This involves a radical re-assessment of the nature of experience itself, and understanding how there are structural problems in the way that we understand our own experience that are at the root of suffering. This will be discussed in much more detail later on in the Insight into sense experience.

## Differentiate between 
- productive thought, goal orientated thought, working thoughts
- frivolous thought, daydreams, imagination, worry 
- all the second category can be replaced with awareness of the sense fields

there is no stress whatsoever in simple sense experience, just seeing. There is lots of stress in regretting the past, mentally churning over situations and worrying about the future. Simply by reducing the time you spend in unnecessary thought, and increasing the time you spend with the senses, you can greatly reduce your stress and enormously improve the quality of your life. But of course merely knowing this does not solve the problem, which is why we are practising here is a method to return to sense experience wherever possible, and only let the mind use thinking ability when absolutely necessary.

Fear not! This practice will not cause you to lose the ability to think. Thinking happens automatically anyway, it is not something that you actively do. Hopefully these exercises will allow you to see that for yourself. If anything, this practice will give you more control of your mind to not be overwhelmed by incessant, invasive or negative thoughts.

## how to alter your reality in the most fundamental way
- Change the object of perception 
- Being with the senses is how to practice the instructions in satipaṭṭhāna sutta going coming back, walking standing sitting lying down, eating, drinking talking being quiet 
- stay with awareness of what's just happened at the five senses doors
- doing this habitually changes the habit pattern of the mind
- bringing it to the five senses decreases useless thinking, worrying, fantasising, useless speculation
