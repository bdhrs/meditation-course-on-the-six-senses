This common Pāḷi expression reveals three different types of selves

> *ayaṃ kho pana, bhikkhave, sakkāyasamudayagāminī paṭipadā – cakkhuṃ ‘etaṃ mama, esohamasmi, eso me attā’ti samanupassati*
> 
> This is the way, monks, which leads to the arising of a sense of self. Regarding the eye, one considers, 'This is mine, this is me / I am this, this is my self.'
> 
> -- *MN 148 chachakkasutta*

The first, *etaṃ mama*, is a self in relation in things, which can possess, own and control things. The self that *has*.

The second, *esohamasmi*, is a psychological self which we identify with. 

The third, *eso me attā*, is a spiritual self or soul, an everlasting self, beyond the material realm. The one that *is*.

The Buddha denied the independent existence of any of these three kinds of self. In all situations he encouraged the identification and eradication of any sense of self, wheresoever it arises. 

> *ayaṃ kho pana, bhikkhave, sakkāyanirodhagāminī paṭipadā – cakkhuṃ ‘netaṃ mama, nesohamasmi, na meso attā’ti samanupassati.*
> 
> This is the way, monks, which leads to the ending of a sense of self. Regarding the eye, one considers, 'This is not mine, this is not me / I am not this, this is not my self.'
