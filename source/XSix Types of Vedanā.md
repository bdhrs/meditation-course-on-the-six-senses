*Vedanā* are often subdivided into different types. The Bahuvedanīya Sutta in Majjhima Nikāya contains an analysis of two types, three types, five types, six types, eighteen types, thirty six types, even one hundred and eight types of *vedanā*.

But for now let's just look an an analysis of *vedanā* in to six types, as found in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.

> *sāmisaṃ vā sukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayamāno ‘sāmisaṃ sukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayāmī’ti pajānāti, nirāmisaṃ vā sukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayamāno ‘nirāmisaṃ sukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayāmī’ti pajānāti. sāmisaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayamāno ‘sāmisaṃ dukkhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayāmī’ti pajānāti, nirāmisaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayamāno ‘nirāmisaṃ dukkhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayāmī’ti pajānāti. sāmisaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayamāno ‘sāmisaṃ adukkhamasukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayāmī’ti pajānāti, nirāmisaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayamāno ‘nirāmisaṃ adukkhamasukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayāmī’ti pajānāti.*

> When experiencing a fleshly pleasant *vedanā*...
> When experiencing a not-of-the-flesh pleasant *vedanā*...
> 
> When experiencing a fleshly unpleasant *vedanā*...
> When experiencing a not-of-the-flesh unpleasant *vedanā*...
> 
> When experiencing a fleshly neutral *vedanā*...
> When experiencing a not-of-the-flesh neutral *vedanā*...
> 
> One knows, "I am experiencing (such a type) of *vedanā*.

Here we have the there types of *vedanā* subdivided into two categories, *sāmisa* and *nirāmisa*. *Āma* literally means 'raw meat' in Pāḷi, so *sāmisa* is *vedanā* associated with the flesh, the material world, the five senses, with household life. And its counterpart, *nirāmisa*, is not-of-the-flesh, related to the mental world, renunciation and monastic life.

Even a monastic experiences material pleasures of sights, sounds, tastes, and physical sensations, but *nirāmisa* is really referring to the pleasure of meditation, the *dukkha* of striving and wanting liberation, and the neutral *vedanā* of total equanimity.

An example is given in the Sutta on the Analysis of Saḷāyatana:

> kudāssu nāmāhaṃ tadāyatanaṃ upasampajja viharissāmi yadariyā etarahi āyatanaṃ upasampajja viharantī’ti iti anuttaresu vimokkhesu pihaṃ upaṭṭhāpayato uppajjati pihapaccayā domanassaṃ. yaṃ evarūpaṃ domanassaṃ idaṃ vuccati nekkhammasitaṃ domanassaṃ.
> 
> Oh when will I attain in that dimension which the nobles attain and remain in? Thus, arousing desire for for the highest states of liberation, mental distress arises based on that longing. That is called mental distress of renunciation.
>

These are simply the three types of *vedanā* experienced in relation to the five senses and
