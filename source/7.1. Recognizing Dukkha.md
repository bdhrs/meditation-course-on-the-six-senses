*Dukkha* is another Pāḷi word with such a broad scope of meanings, that no single English word can encompass it fully. On a physical level, *dukkha* is aches and pains. On a mental level, *dukkha* is everything from stress and anxiety to full-on paranoia and depression. But these aren't the real problem, as we also experience physical comfort and pleasure, and mental calm and happiness. 

The kind of *dukkha* that the Buddha was talking about in the Four Noble Truths is not something that gets experienced from time to time, like physical pain and mental stress. It is an inherent quality of experience itself. The fact that everything is constructed and conditioned, means it can never last, cannot provide any lasting satisfaction, or be a permanent basis upon which to build one's life, cannot be relied on. This kind of *dukkha* is sometimes called existential *dukkha* or structural *dukkha*. In some suttas it is called *saṅkhāradukkhatā*, the fact of suffering inherent in conditioned phenomena.

> *dukkhaṃ, dukkhanti, āvuso sāriputta, vuccati. katamaṃ nu kho, āvuso, dukkhanti?* 
> 
> *tisso imā, āvuso, dukkhatā. dukkhadukkhatā, saṅkhāradukkhatā, vipariṇāmadukkhatā – imā kho, āvuso, tisso dukkhatā"ti.*
> -- *SN38.14 dukkhapañhāsuttaṃ*

> It is said, '*dukkha dukkha*.' What is this *dukkha*, venerable?
> 
> There are three states of *dukkha*. The state of actual *dukkha*, the state of *dukkha* inherent in conditions, and the state of *dukkha* inherent in change.


So, keep in mind that when we talk about *dukkha* from here onwards, we are not talking about *dukkha-vedanā* or some unpleasant experience, we are talking about bigger picture *dukkha*, an inherent quality of existence which is part of the conditioned structure of life. 

## Nobody wants to talk about *dukkha*

As a society, we're programmed to avoid the topic of *dukkha*. Talking about it can make people really uncomfortable. But the reverse is true, not facing the reality of *dukkha*, and being constantly ambushed by it from every side is grounds for severe unhappiness, stress, anxiety and depression.

People act as if *not* thinking about it and *not* talking about it will somehow make *dukkha* go away, like a child covering their eyes to make someone disappear, or someone covering their ears and shouting, "La la la la la" to avoid hearing something they don't want to hear, so they can pretend it does't exist. 

These are all facts of life. 

- Every birth ends in death.
- Every young person become a sick old person. 
- Every body ends up as worm food or dust. 
- Every relationship, be it family, friend, lover or pet, ends in separation or death.
- Every plate and cup ends in pieces.
- Every car ends on the scrapyard.
- Every expensive consumer electronic item ends in a junk heap.
- Every flower withers and decays.
- Every mouthful of fine food ends in the toilet.
- Every sip of a delicious drink ends as urine. 

Observe how your mind recoils from these facts. Do you find these basic facts of existence depressing? The real question is why should the most common occurrences be so abhorrent to think about? Why do the most inevitable events come as a big surprise and shock when they happen? 

As humans we place enormous faith in things which are constructed and conditioned—things like health, family and children, career, status, wealth, material possessions, land, property, political affiliation, gender identity, national identity, even life itself. Structurally, there's no possibility of getting permanent fulfilment from impermanent things. This is *dukkha*. 

As an example, no matter how much organic food we eat, no matter how many nutritional supplements we take, no matter what health practices we undertake, no matter what exercises regimen we perform, we are all still going to get old, sick and die. All 8 billion of us will be dead in a little more than a century. This is *dukkha*.

It's unavoidable, but still, we do our very best to try and avoid thinking about it.

## So, let's talk about *dukkha*

Developing a sane response to the reality of *dukkha* starts with facing the facts. 

> *jātipi dukkhā, jarāpi dukkhā, maraṇampi dukkhaṃ, sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsāpi dukkhā, appiyehi sampayogopi dukkho, piyehi vippayogopi dukkho, yampicchaṃ na labhati tampi dukkhaṃ, saṃkhittena pañcupādānakkhandhā dukkhā – idaṃ vuccatāvuso, dukkhaṃ.*
> -- *MN9 sammādiṭṭhisuttaṃ*

> Birth is *dukkha*, old age is *dukkha*, death is *dukkha*, grief, wailing, pain, suffering and trouble are *dukkha*, association with the unloved is *dukkha*, separation from the loved is *dukkha*, not getting what one wants is *dukkha*, in short, the clinging to the aggregates of existence is *dukkha*. This, sir, is what is called *dukkha*. 

*Dukkha* is a fact of life, there's no way around it.  

The Buddha summed up this up very succinctly with the statement

> *yadaniccaṃ taṃ dukkhaṃ.*
> -- *SN35.1 ajjhattāniccasuttaṃ*
 
> Whatever is impermanent is *dukkha*.

You could express this in so may ways. 

Whatever is impermanent cannot be a source of permanent satisfaction. 

Whatever is unstable cannot be a foundation for stable gratification. 

Whatever is temporary cannot be a condition for lasting happiness.

As we have seen for ourselves in meditation, every single experience is *anicca*, every component of experience is *anicca*. Everything that results from experience as *anicca*. So how is it possible to get anything permanent from impermanent experience? This is the simplest way to connect that fact of impermanence within our own experience with the overarching, all-encompassing reality of existential *dukkha*.

Seeing this clearly, will we try and seek gratification or lasting satisfaction in impermanent experiences? No, we will not. 

## Meditation on recognizing *dukkha*

Let's do a practical meditation exercise to learn to recognize *dukkha*, not as some abstract concept, but a tangible reality within our own experience.
