"Where is my mind?" you may ask.

We live in a world of mental experience every waking moment 24/7/365. All the senses converge on the mind, are known by the mind, and are responded to by the mind. Without the mind, there is, quite literally, no experience whatsoever.

For some starting with meditation on *saḷāyatana*, the mind as a sense is the most difficult thing to grasp in the beginning, the most difficult to perceive distinctly from the other senses. It's like we humans spend our entire life immersed in a gaseous atmosphere, without which we'd die in a few minutes, and yet we can say, "What air? I don't see any air. " In the same way, someone may say, "What mind? I don't see any mind. I only see trees and people and cars." But later it becomes obvious that you've only ever seen trees and people and cars in your mind.

As one progresses with introspection, mind become the easiest sense to perceive, not only because it is ubiquitous, but because it is so fast and relentless in its activity. It is so busy gathering information from the other five sense, collating them, interpreting them, and forming responses to them, that it becomes very easy to see and follow. There is not a single moment when mental phenomena are not available to experience, except perhaps in the deepest states of sleep and coma.

The Buddha himself remarked that his basic awareness consists of mental objects, namely feeling tone, perceptions and thoughts, and this was to be considered a remarkable quality.

> *tasmātiha tvaṃ, ānanda, idampi tathāgatassa acchariyaṃ abbhutadhammaṃ dhārehi. idhānanda, tathāgatassa viditā vedanā uppajjanti, viditā upaṭṭhahanti, viditā abbhatthaṃ gacchanti, viditā saññā uppajjanti, viditā upaṭṭhahanti, viditā abbhatthaṃ gacchanti, viditā vitakkā uppajjanti, viditā upaṭṭhahanti, viditā abbhatthaṃ gacchanti.* 
> 
> Therefore Ananda, you should remember this too as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Tathāgata. For him, the feeling tone of experiences are known as they arise, persist and disappear, perceptions are known as they arise persist and disappear, thoughts are known as they arise persist and disappear.
> 
> -- *MN123 acchariyaabbhutasuttaṃ*

The speed at which the mind changes rendered the Buddha, a veritable master of similes, at a total loss for something to compare it with.

> *nāhaṃ, bhikkhave, aññaṃ ekadhammampi samanupassāmi yaṃ evaṃ lahuparivattaṃ yathayidaṃ cittaṃ. yāvañcidaṃ, bhikkhave, upamāpi na sukarā yāva lahuparivattaṃ cittanti.*
> 
> Monks I don't see a single other thing that's as fast-changing as the mind. So much so that it's not easy to make a simile about how fast changing the mind is.

The Buddha also humorously quipped:

> no ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhu paracittapariyāyakusalo hoti, atha ‘sacittapariyāyakusalo bhavissāmī’ti – evañhi vo, bhikkhave, sikkhitabbaṃ.
> 
> Monks, if you are not skilled in reading others' minds, then you should train like this, "I will be skilled in reading my own mind."

So with that, let's learn to read our own minds.

These are just some examples to give you an idea of the range of mental experiences. It's in no way exhaustive, in fact it's almost impossible to exhaust the range of mental experiences. But these should be enough for you to recognize mental experiences as they occur within the mental field.

Pay attention to your mental experiences.

Understand these are all just the mental field, within the field of the mind.

---
Notice how the mind changes relentlessly, nothing stays still even for one second.

Attention moves between all the senses, perceptions and thoughts arise, responses are formed, knowing is always present and shifting.


---
Notice how you like certain thoughts, how you dislike certain thoughts, how you are indifferent to certain thoughts. 

---
Right now, the important thing is not to analyse every little phenomena that occurs in the mind, but simple to understand that this is mental activity, these are mental phenomena, these are mental processes, these are all occurring within the mental domain.

---
The important skill to develop is simply to understand when an experience is within the field of mind, to be able to clearly distinguish five sense experiences from mental ones.

---
Keep coming back to this sense of mind. Give it your full attention.
%%

The mind is another area that can continuously be paid attention to, it is suitable as a primary object of meditation. So much so that the mind and mental phenomena are respectively the third and fourth categories in the *satipaṭṭhāna* system.

Please continue studying the sense of mind until you are familiar with its basic details, then move on to open awareness.
