## Mahāyāna Emptiness
Mahāyāna took this idea further to mean that if nothing had it's own inherent essence then everything exists through interconnection, or interbeing as it is sometimes called. This is an interesting philosophical development on the concept of emptiness, but it's worth noting that this id'a is never found in the earliest discourses of the Buddha, and was a later development in Buddhist thought.

## Reality is an illusion
The only reality you know is what is perceived through the senses. We've seen very clearly that sense experience is a shimmering and ephemeral illusion. But that illusion is the only thing you've got to work with, quite literally you know nothing else other than that, so back to work.

## Body and mind training
To train the body, you need to stretch it and move it.
To train the mind, you need to keep it still.


## psychology of sense reception
There's an absolute minimum threshold below which sense perception does not occur, that is binary on or off. It's not like a sound keeps getting softer and softer, before a certain threshold it disappears entirely. How does this match with Buddhist idea? 

Signal Detection Theory is about how you can focus on one stimulus among many, one voice in a room full of conversations, and give it exclusive attention, to the point that other voices are not audible.

Sensory Adaptation is when a sound is so regular and repetitive that you do heading it, and only hear it again when it changes in some way. Saliva has a flavour but you never taste it.

Sounds are collected by the external ear and funneled to the tympanic membrane ear drum which vibrates … Technical stuff … In short physical vibrations are converted into electrical signals which are carried adding the auditory nerve to your brain stem.

The main difference between cognitive psychology and Buddhist model of sense perception is that the one is objective, and the other is subjective. Psychology has much to say about which regions of the brain sounds and specifically speech get processed, but none of those processes are available to experience. The brain is really s black box as far as experience goes, you can't even feel most of it with the sense of touch. The first time sound becomes available to introspection is when it occurs in the mind, something which the physical sciences struggle to explain. There is literally no accepted theory of min mind or consciousness, despite the fact that every human being has subjective knowledge of conscious experiences.

## Brain vs mind
In Buddhist philosophy, 'mano' (mind) is not anatomically equivalent to the brain as a physical organ, but rather a metaphysical construct representing consciousness, perception, and cognitive processes.

This suggests an insight rather than a mistake. The Buddhist understanding of mind transcends mere neurological function, viewing it as a dynamic, experiential faculty capable of perceiving mental phenomena. Unlike Western scientific materialism, which locates consciousness in neural networks, Buddhist epistemology sees 'mano' as a sophisticated sensing mechanism for thoughts, intentions, and mental states.

The distinction highlights different paradigms of understanding consciousness: one rooted in physical structure, the other in experiential phenomenology.

## Body sensations
aching, burning, buzzing, cascading, chafing, clenching, clicking, coursing, cramping, drooping, floating, flowing, fluttering, freezing, gnawing, itching, jabbing, numbing, pinching, pinging, popping, pricking, pulling, pulsating, pulsing, pushing, quivering, radiating, rippling, sagging, scalding, searing, shooting, sizzling, smarting, spreading, squeezing, stabbing, stinging, streaming, surging, throbbing, tickling, tingling, trickling, twitching
## Present moment awareness
But what is present moment awareness? As you examine your own experience more, developing the skill of introspection, it will become apparent that present moment awareness is actually awareness of the most very recent past event, the very last thing that happened. Perceiving through the senses is one thing, and awareness of that experience is another thing. So mindfulness of sense experience is really being aware of what has just happened, present moment awareness following right behind the most recently passed sense experience.

## How to deal with pain
- normally we do everything to run away from pain
- i'm recommending the exact opposite
- go so deeply into that it stops being perceived as pain
- what type of physical pain do you often experience?
- what is the location?
- what is the shape? 
- what is the sensation?
- there are only really a few sensations
- pushing, pulling, burning or hot, tingling, 
- go into the micro phenomena of the pain
- physical experience is not painful
- the body just passes on information about sensations
- pain is only experienced in the mind., not in the body
- go so deeply into the physical aspect that your perception alters

## open awareness recording
If the mind is distracted and confused, just know that this is the "mind channel".

If the mind is fast and highly perceptive, just know that this is the "mind channel".

You don't have to be in the mood to do this. Whatever mood you're in is just "mind channel".

 the experience might be in a different field no problem just you just follow whatever attention prsents to you. wherever the mind goes, just follow. the mind has been doing this for as long as you've been alive. how to do this now you're just watching what the mind does so that you can learn from it understand it. to build understanding all you have to do at this stage is know very briefly what channel the experiences happening on, this is seeing, this is hearing, this is smelling, this is tasting, this is physical experience, this is mental experience, that's all. and stay with the experience note the channel that's enough for now. if knowing the channel is difficult then at very least stay with the experience.


for some people this comes very naturally for other people it's an uphill battle from the word go. get the benefits its good. always useful things that come from this practice, every little bit of self understanding helps you to improve knowing yourself better. there's no disadvantage to knowing how you work how the mind works how this body works. on this the sense fields work is not disadvantage denying that advantage and further advantageous in every single possible way.

your biggest challenge in the beginning is you're going to default to thinking and planning daydreaming memory memories are you going to go to the mind and do not going to know that you've gone to the mind as soon as you become aware note that this is mental experience. that's helps to give you just one step back, get a little bit of perspective. that's the most common default pattern with modern human beings is to go into the thought world and not actually know that you're in thought, just be so absorbed in the story that you're not aware that it's just a story. so this is the most important ground level practice this is the practice that you need to be able to default to at all times that is the foundation for everything which follows if you need to spend more time here spend as much time as you need to get a good foundation is really really important you don't need to build a perfect foundation you just need to have a basic awareness of what is happening and the further steps will help you to develop a more solid funded foundation. so don't think you need to do this perfectly even monks with twenty years of meditation experience are not perfect everyday, but good enough to to see what's happening that's that's enough of a basis for going deeper into the buddha's teachings on saḷāyatana so if you need to spend a day here spend a few days, spend a week. if you need to but don't don't get stuck here this this way but wait there's more, there's so much more but this is a necessary foundation a necessary prerequisite. it's also something that can be done throughout the day in daily life this is something that you can really bring into your life at all times there are some times where you have to fully engage with thinking while doing some work when interacting with other people but there's a lot of free time to sit and notice experience. and using all your free time and my free time i mean eating time washing time toilet time brushing teeth time drinking time walking time all of these kind of less important activities you can be practicing open awareness. the main thing is this practice doesn't need to be done in a sitting posture it can be done in any posture setting lying standing walking sitting lying down moving sitting still stretching anything in between. experience is always happening irrespective of what posture the body is in. so don't think this needs to be done in lotus position. my favorite is walking meditation. take this meditation and go for a solitary nature walk. its to wonderful wonderful way to get some fresh air, good exercise and get some good mental exercise as well. you could expand this into a little section how to walk in nature. each one of these is heading and paragraph, heading and a paragraph. and then over time you'll build up but if content on each one. is it then you can put your paragraphs into some kind of structure

## One at a time
I question this idea:
The inner experience seems so rich and complex, so it might be surprising to learn that the mind can only take **one object of experience at a time**. Although the full six sense sensorium is *available* to experience at any one moment, only one thing at a time is in the spotlight of attention. The incredible speed of the mind is what gives the impression of things happening at the same time. This is usually not immediately apparent to most people, but I have confidence that, over the duration of this course, you can develop the acuity of attention to begin to see this for yourself through introspection.

## Taste
Interestingly, the classification of tastes is not universal, and different cultures identify different tastes. The western world typically talks about the five primary tastes of sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and *umami* or savoury, although the latter was only discovered in 1908 in Japan and officially added in 1996 by researchers at the University of Miami.

Indian texts from ancient times have always referred to six tastes, which are in integral part of the *āyurveda* medical system. The order they are found in the oldest Buddhist texts is:

1. *ambila* (sour) like lemon, tamarind
2. tittaka (bitter) like bitter gourd, leafy greens, coffee, dark chocolate
3. kaṭuka (pungent) like onion, garlic
4. *madhura* (sweet) like dates, melon, pumpkin, sugar cane 
5. *khārika* (alkaline or astringent) like unripe bananas, pomegranate, alfalfa sprouts
6. *loṇika* (salty) like salt, seaweed, soy sauce, tamari

## experiencing matter directly
For example when you look at the world around you, matter seems to be a solid and stable—things that you see this morning will be the same later today, tomorrow, next week and next month. You might know from a scientific point of view that matter is much more unstable than it appears, but that knowledge is not available to experience, it is only theoretical.

By training your attention, the instability of matter becomes something that can be experienced directly, it can become available to perception, and be very physically and very viscerally sensed. This is a very reliable outcome of training that many meditators progress to. Through basic training, it is possible to become aware of much more detail, with much more clarity than you are experiencing right now.

## Beyond your experience
One thing to keep in mind is that we cannot imagine where this practice goes. It's like trying to imagine an undescribed place that's not on the map. We have so little knowledge about how our minds work, that it is impossible to predict the experiences, mental states, understandings, benefits and enhancements that come from doing this practice based on our current model of reality.

It's not just from an appeal to antiquity that Buddhist monks say, "Hey! You should really try this meditation method, which is found in ancient Pāḷi texts". It's because the meditation works effectively at relieving the fundamental suffering of human beings, and offers new vistas of insight into the subjective world of experience that all human beings, ancient or modern, inhabit.

This is not the teaching of some philosopher or scientist or popular personality, this is the teaching of a Buddha, an awakened being. We are fortunate to have such an encounter with a teaching which slowly, successively, and with practice, leads to the same awakening that the Buddha himself experienced.

Ultimately, this is about using experience to entirely transcend experience. Firstly the experience of the sense world, then the experience of the entire mental world, and ultimately all experience itself. That's a long journey from where we are right now, but know that this is where the practice goes.

So let's practice the meditation on emptiness to lighten the load.

Someone came to the Buddha and asked him how to know when the job is done, the training is complete.

## Vajirā

> *evaṃ khandhesu santesu, hoti sattoti sammuti.*

## Process Retreat
1. go through written notes and process
2. go through kindle notes themselves, deleting as you do

## Know Thyself
What we are talking about here is a process of putting yourself under self-observation. How better to learn about yourself than by watching yourself, knowing each and every experience that makes up your waking reality? 

If you were a zoologist, and wished to study the habits and behaviours of any animal, you would silently watch it, follow its movements day and night, keep it under continuous observation so that its tiniest habits were revealed. If you had access to that animal's inner world of experience, how much more would you understand about it? This is precisely what we're doing here, putting the inner world of a human being under observation in order to truly understand how it operates.

## Be Interested
A very easy way to make rapid progress in any meditation, is to be very interested in the theme of meditation. And, perhaps more importantly, to sustain interest in it over time. Interest includes a sense of curiosity, "What's going on here?", "How does this work?", "What can I learn about this?". Like active thinking, interest is useful in the beginning, but also has to be abandoned later at a certain point, in order to proceed to a further level that requires a cultivated disinterest in experience. But if you're not at that stage yet, use interest to power your progress in internal development.

## Base Level
Sometimes meditation practice can feel overwhelming or bewildering, like being lost in a mental maze of our own creation. If ever you feel lost, confused, unsure what you are doing, or what you should be doing, just come back to this base level of knowing what's happening at the sense level. Often it is enough to pull you out of bewilderment.

## Samādhi
Reference samādhi based on relinquishment

## Dukkha
Connect dukkha with the four noble truths

## Peyyāla
In the intro, take one heavily peyyāla'd sutta from saḷāyatanasaṃyutta and ask why reading this doesn't awaken us. At the end of the course, show the same sutta, and show how our understanding has completely changed.

## Beyond Language
Find references, related to nirodha, about where the five aggregates or six sense fields cease, so does language

## 3 Anatta Contemplations
1. anatta
2. netaṃ mama etc
3. suñño loko

## Qualities of a Self
What are the qualities that a self is supposed to have? It should be autonomous. It should be able to make decisions and act on them.

Go through the process of eating, chewing, and swallowing and see what is under control.

Can you change your skin colour?
Can you change your eye colour?
Can you set your heart rate?
Can you increase blood flow to your left arm?
Can you improve your eyesight?
Can you increase the frequency range of your hearing?
Can you increase bile production in the liver?
Can you stop thinking in meditation?

The answer to all of these is no.

> *yasmā ca kho, bhikkhave, rūpaṃ anattā, tasmā rūpaṃ ābādhāya saṃvattati, na ca labbhati rūpe – ‘evaṃ me rūpaṃ hotu, evaṃ me rūpaṃ mā ahosī"’ti.*
> -- *SN22.59 anattalakkhaṇasuttaṃ*

> Because the body is not oneself, it leads to affliction, and it isn't achievable with the body to go, "May my body be like this", "May my body not be like this." 

> You can move the muscles 
> That pull the strings
> That make the puppet
> Dance and sing

The last bastion of any sense of self is the knower, the perceiver—what is normally called consciousness or awareness. Sure, the body's not under any kind of control but surely consciousness must be oneself? Again

> *viññāṇañca hidaṃ, bhikkhave, attā abhavissa, nayidaṃ viññāṇaṃ ābādhāya saṃvatteyya, labbhetha ca viññāṇe – ‘evaṃ me viññāṇaṃ hotu, evaṃ me viññāṇaṃ mā ahosī’ti.*
> -- *SN22.59 anattalakkhaṇasuttaṃ*

> If consciousness were a self, it would never lead to affliction. And it would be achievable with consciousness to go, "May my consciousness be like thus", "May my consciousness not be like this." 

Another relevant argument quoted by Ānanda

> *"cakkhuñca, āvuso, paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇa"nti? "evamāvuso"ti. "yo cāvuso, hetu, yo ca paccayo cakkhuviññāṇassa uppādāya, so ca hetu, so ca paccayo sabbena sabbaṃ sabbathā sabbaṃ aparisesaṃ nirujjheyya. api nu kho cakkhuviññāṇaṃ paññāyethā"ti? "no hetaṃ, āvuso". "imināpi kho etaṃ, āvuso, pariyāyena bhagavatā akkhātaṃ vivaṭaṃ pakāsitaṃ – ‘itipidaṃ viññāṇaṃ anattāti*

## Purpose of anatta
What is the real purpose of all this discussion and meditation on *anatta*? Without removing the sense of identity which inherently occupies the mind—like a squatter who has taken up permanent residence—it is impossible to becomes disenchanted (*nibbidā*) let desire for existence fade (*virāga*)and stop incessant become (*nirodha*) in order to experience the fire going out (*nibbāna*). Taking experience personally prevents one entirely from experiencing the Unconditioned, which is impersonal. *Anattasaññā* is not the goal, merely a necessary step towards the destination.

## Rebirth without anyone being reborn
One unique and interesting fact of the Buddha's teachings is his emphasis on two seemingly contradictory ideas: rebirth, without anyone substantive being who gets reborn. Rebirth is always attributed to the process of dependent origination, not to a soul.

## Nirodha
Dependent origination is itself a description of *nirodha*.

> *atha kho, bhikkhave, sutavato ariyasāvakassa aparappaccayā ñāṇamevettha hoti – ‘imasmiṃ asati idaṃ na hoti, imassa nirodhā idaṃ nirujjhati. avijjāya asati saṅkhārā na honti, saṅkhāresu asati viññāṇaṃ na hoti, viññāṇe asati nāmarūpaṃ na hoti, nāmarūpe asati saḷāyatanaṃ na hoti…pe… jātiyā asati jarāmaraṇaṃ na hotī’ti. so evaṃ pajānāti – ‘evamayaṃ loko nirujjhatī"’ti.*

## Don't get stuck anywhere for too long
It's important to not get stuck on any single experience for too long. Sure, analyse something as much as you need to, but *dhammānupassanā* works best best when you let the phenomena flow through you naturally. Damming them up creates subtle tension in the mind and can have psychologically stressful results. In short, watch the river, don't stop the river.

## Last ten suttas of MN
The last ten suttas of Majjhima Nikāya are all based on an examination of *saḷāyatana*. This feature of powerful suttas at the end of a section also occurs in the Saḷāyatana Saṃyutta in the Saṃyutta NIkāya. It is evident that these discourses were specially placed in a prominent positions, and held in particularly high esteem by the very early Buddhist community, something that the modern tradition has sometimes forgotten.

## Nibbidā

After this, it's just a matter of spending sufficient time in this place for ever more subtle aspects of experience to appear and be cleansed by deep understanding. 

It's like being a chicken in the egg, waiting to hatch. It will happen naturally when the conditions ripen, not before. This is the real test of patience, *khantī paramaṃ*, because any act of will at this stage is really going in the opposite direction.

> *khantī paramaṃ tapo titikkhā,*
> *nibbānaṃ paramaṃ vadanti buddhā*
> -- *DHP14 buddhavagga, verse 184*

> Patience, endurance, is the supreme spiritual practice, 
> Nibbāna is supreme say the Buddhas

At this stage, we need to just watch and wait while the gradual process of *virāga* and *nirodha* mature by themselves. It's very organic. There really is nothing to be done.

## Virāga

## Nirodha

*Nirodha* means stopping, ending, cessation.

> *"rūpadhātuṃ pariññāya, arūpesu asaṇṭhitā,*
> *nirodhe ye vimuccanti, te janā maccuhāyino.*
> -- *ITI51 dhātusutta*

> !!! translation

Symbolically it is referred to as 'reaching the end of the world'.

> *"na kho panāhaṃ, āvuso, appatvā lokassa antaṃ dukkhassa antakiriyaṃ vadāmi. api ca khvāhaṃ, āvuso, imasmiṃyeva byāmamatte kaḷevare sasaññimhi samanake lokañca paññapemi lokasamudayañca lokanirodhañca lokanirodhagāminiñca paṭipadanti.*

There's nothing you can *do* to stop. Stopping means *stopping* doing. This is as far as activity can take you on the path. All you can do is watch and wait—without the faintest glimmer of interest—as things cool down by themselves.

This is expressed in the famous Bāhiya Sutta as:

> "tasmātiha te, bāhiya, evaṃ sikkhitabbaṃ – ‘diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṃ bhavissati, sute sutamattaṃ bhavissati, mute mutamattaṃ bhavissati, viññāte viññātamattaṃ bhavissatī’ti.

This is pointing at something very few people get to experience in life—awareness without the proliferation of concepts that usually accompany it. We see the thing and stop there, knowing it as it is, uncoloured by *vedanā*, concepts, opinions, and active responses. This is the necessary state to be in to make the leap from the normal conditioned world to the unconditioned—from the blazing fire of normal everyday sense experience, to the fire cooling down and going out.!
