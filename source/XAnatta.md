## Relationship between a self and the world
There's a lot of academic quibbling on how to translate the Pāḷi term *anatta*, Sanskrit *anātman*, but whether you consider it to be 'non-self', or 'not self', or 'not oneself', more important is the understand of the relationship it is referring to.

If x is anything in the entire physical or mental universe, and i as a self: 
- x ≠ i (x is not me)
- i ≠ x (I am not x)
- i ∌ x (I do not contain x)
- x ∌ i (x does not contain me)
- i ∉ x (I am not in x)
- x ∉ i (x is not in me)

These ideas are frequently found in Pāḷi texts in relation to the five aggregates

> *na rūpaṃ attato samanupassati, na rūpavantaṃ vā attānaṃ, na attani vā rūpaṃ, na rūpasmiṃ vā attānaṃ.*
> 
> He does not the body as oneself, or oneself as having a body, or the body within oneself, or oneself within the body.
> 
> -- *SN41.3 dutiyaisidattasutta*

And likewise for every other aggregate.

It is also expressed in terms of every element of sense experience.

> *idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu cakkhuṃ na maññati, cakkhusmiṃ na maññati, cakkhuto na maññati, cakkhuṃ meti na maññati.*
> 
> Here, monks, a monk does not imagine a self as the eye, does not imagine a self in the eye, does not imagine a self coming from the eye, does not imagine the eye is mine.
> 
> -- *SN35.30 samugghātasāruppasuttaṃ* 

And likewise for every other component of sense experience.

## Giving up interest in self

> *sabbe dhammā anattā'ti,*  
> *yadā paññāya passati,*  
> *atha nibbindati dukkhe,*    
> *esa maggo visuddhiyā.*  
> 
> All phenomena are not oneself,
> When one sees this with wisdom,
> Then one becomes dis-enchanted with suffering,
> This is the path to purification.
