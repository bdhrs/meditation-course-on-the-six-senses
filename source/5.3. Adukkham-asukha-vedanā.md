Because neutral *vedanā* are more difficult to discern, here's a simile to clarify. 

When the room you are in is too hot, you notice it is hot. Or, if the room is too cold, you notice that it is cold. But if the temperature is just right, then you are not aware of the temperature in the room. 

If asked, "Is it hot?", your answer would be "No." 

If asked, "Is it cold?", your answer would also be "No." 

If asked, "Does that mean there is no temperature?", again your answer would be "No." 

The room has a temperature, but you don't notice it because it is exactly where it is comfortable for you. That doesn't mean there is no temperature.

In the same way, *adukkham-asukha-vedanā* does not mean there is *no* *vedanā*, it just means it's neither *sukha* nor *dukkha*. Not pleasant, not unpleasant, just neutral. When something makes no impact on the mind, there's no urgency to pay attention, so the tendency is to ignore it.

With that in mind, let's do a practical exercise to identify *adukkham-asukkha-vedanā* within experience.
