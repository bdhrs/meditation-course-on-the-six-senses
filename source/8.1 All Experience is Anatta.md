At last we come to the heart of the matter.

> *cakkhu attā’ti yo vadeyya taṃ na upapajjati. cakkhussa uppādopi vayopi paññāyati. yassa kho pana uppādopi vayopi paññāyati, ‘attā me uppajjati ca veti cā’ti iccassa evamāgataṃ hoti. tasmā taṃ na upapajjati – ‘cakkhu attā’ti yo vadeyya. iti cakkhu anattā.*
> -- *MN 148 chachakkasuttaṃ*

> Whoever says, "I am the eye / the eye is me", that is unacceptable. The coming into being and disappearance of the eye is evident. Then one would have to conclude, "I am coming into being and disappearing". Therefore it is unacceptable to say, "I am the eye / the eye is me". The eye is not oneself.

By the same logic, the sutta goes on to discuss every aspect of six sense experience from the same logic.

> Whoever says, "I am visible forms / visible forms are me" …
> 
> Whoever says, "I am eye consciousness / eye consciousness is me" …
> 
> Whoever says, "I am visual experience / visual experience is me" …
> 
> Whoever says, "I am *vedanā* / *vedanā* is me" …
> 
> Whoever says, "I am craving / craving is me", that is unacceptable. The coming into being and disappearance of the craving is evident. Then one would have to conclude, "I am coming into being and disappearing". Therefore it is unacceptable to say, "I am craving / craving is me". Craving is not oneself.

What is this sutta emphasising? If the process of experience is entirely made out of parts, and all those parts are dependent on each other, then it's impossible for one of the parts to be some kind of permanent essence or Self. And yet, this is exactly what we believe. 

It doesn't matter if you come from an Abrahamic religion and believe in a soul, or follow Hindu ideas and believe in a Higher Self, or even if you are a scientific atheist with no belief. Still, we almost all believe and act as if there's a self right here in experience—an *experiencer*, if you will. Nobody even questions the validity of this belief, it seems to be a self-evident truth. But when we analyse experience, subjectively or objectively, it turns out to be a false idea, an unfounded belief.

We consider ourselves to be rational human beings, and yet this magical belief of an experiencing self persists, despite all evidence to the contrary. There certainly is the *illusion* of a continuous self that's experiencing the objective material world, and having this inner subjective experience. But when we zoom into experience, we can clearly see it is made out of component parts, and that there's no self hiding within any of the parts, or outside the parts, or in relation to any of the parts.

Without any investigation, almost all of us take consciousness to be some kind of continuous entity, our true being. "Sure, consciousness keeps changing," we might say, "yet I'm still the same person". But if we put consciousness under the spotlight, it becomes obvious that it is completely dependent on things which are very clearly not oneself, leading to the ridiculous situation mentioned in the sutta above, where our self must be arising and passing away on the whims of impersonal external objects.

The other thing which we really take to be our self are our wishes, wants, desires and loves. And on the opposite side, our dislikes, grudges, grievances and hatreds. Even the smallest preferences are taken as part of one's self. Nothing could be more personal than what we love and hate, surely? 

Yet an investigation of *vedanā* clearly shows that all our likes and dislikes are based on the impersonal push and pull of feelings in the mind which arise due to their own causes and conditions. So even our personal desires turn out to be highly impersonal and conditioned by external forces.

With that, let's dive into a practical examination of the topic.
## Meditation on all experience is *anatta*

![[08-01-all-experience-is-anatta.mp3]]

%%

This is meditation on *anatta*. The absence of a self. 

Let's begin by examining every aspect of experience to ensure there is no self hiding away in any of the corners of experience.

**Eye**

We can start by examining the process of seeing and all of its components. 

Taking the eyes to be one's self makes no sense. 

Why? The eyes arise at some point and disappear at another, they change and alter. 

If the eyes were a self then you'd have to conclude that the self arises and disappears every time the eyes change. 

That makes no sense, so it's safe to conclude that the eyes are not one's self. 

---
**Visible forms**

Taking visible forms to be one's self makes no sense. 

Why? Visible forms appear and disappear, change and alter. 

If visible forms were your self, then you'd have to conclude that the self arises and disappears every time a form changes.

All phenomena are *anatta*.

Everything is *anatta*.

%%

Spend the day with this meditation. Try your best to accomplish these **two goals**. 

1. Logically, be able to confirm any experience or component of experience is *anatta*.
2. Carefully examine which experiences or aspects of experience create your sense of self. Where does the sense of self find its footing?
